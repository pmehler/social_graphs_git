The '''Femme Fatales''' are a fictional group of female characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. They are often depicted as antagonists to the superhero character [[Spider-Man]] and [[Captain America]].

==Fictional team history==
The Femme Fatales are villains and [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] that serve as mercenaries for hire. Group members Bloodlust and Whiplash have a history of working together prior to joining the Femme Fatales, as members of a previous group called the Band of Baddies.<ref>''Marvel Comic Presents'' #48</ref> They were hired by fellow villain the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] in the disguise of Dr. Turner to threaten an ambassador. Spider-Man intervened and saved the ambassador, making him an enemy of the Femme Fatales. They then joined forces with other villains the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]] and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)#Luis Alvarez|Tarantula]], but all of them were defeated by Spider-Man and his ally the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]. Though the villains got away.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #340, 342-343.</ref>

The Femme Fatales later received an invitation to join [[Superia]] and her organization of female criminals, the [[Femizons]]. They accepted, and battled [[Captain America]] and the [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]] in the process.<ref>''Captain America'' #389-392</ref>

The group would splinter and disband sometime later: Bloodlust and Whiplash was seen at the [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Weapons Expo.<ref>''Captain America'' #411-413</ref>

Bloodlust later lost her powers after [[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]. Mindblast, who retained her powers, briefly allied herself with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] during the "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline.<ref>''Civil War: War Crimes'' #1</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Bloodlust and Mindblast were turned into duplicate [[Maria Hill]]s through the powers of [[Kobik]] in order to keep the Avengers away from Pleasant Hill.<ref>''All-New, All-Different Avengers'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, the Femme Fatales are joined by [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] and [[Sapphire Styx]], with Whiplash changing her name to Snake Whip. The Fatales ambush [[Kitty Pryde]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]] and [[Betsy Braddock|Psylocke]] at the King's Impresario Restaurant at Hightown, [[Madripoor]].<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1-2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Soon joined by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], himself recently taken captive by the Fatales, the X-Men combat the Femme Fatales; during the encounter Sapphire Styx uses her lifeforce-draining ability on Psylocke, but this later backfires and Sapphire Styx is destroyed, enabling Psylocke to create a new body for herself from Sapphire's soul power. Viper gets away with Magneto pursuing her, and the Femme Fatales are locked up.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>
