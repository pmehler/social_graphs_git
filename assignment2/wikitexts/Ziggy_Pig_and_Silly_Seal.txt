'''Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal''' are fictional, [[talking animals in fiction|talking animal]] [[comic-book]] characters created by [[cartoonist]] [[Al Jaffee]] for [[Marvel Comics]]' 1940s predecessor, [[Timely Comics]], during the period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

Initially appearing as individual stars of solo features in the [[comedy]] [[anthology]] ''[[Krazy Komics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d July 1942), they were soon teamed to become, along with [[Super Rabbit]], the most prominent stars of what Timely called its "animation" comics.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |access-date=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/sillyzig.htm |title=Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal}}</ref> With such ''Krazy Komics'' cohorts as Toughy Cat, the [[anthropomorphic]] duo are among the first talking-animal characters created specifically for the fledgling [[mass media|medium]] of comic books, rather than adapted from [[film]], [[comic strips]], or other media. Some stories used the logo '''Silly Seal and Ziggy Pig''', and at least one used simply '''Silly and Ziggy'''.<ref>''All Surprise Comics'' #10 (Summer 1946)</ref>

==Publication history==
Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal were created by [[cartoonist]] [[Al Jaffee]] for [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of [[Marvel Comics]], in the [[comedy]] [[anthology]] [[comic book]] ''[[Krazy Komics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d July 1942). 
Jaffee recalled in a 2004 interview,
{{quote|I created Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal from scratch. <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Editor-in-chief]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> [[Stan Lee|Stan <nowiki>[Lee]</nowiki>]] said to me, 'Create an animated-type character. Something different, something new'. I searched around and thought, 'I’ve never seen anyone do anything about a seal', so I made him the lead character. So I created 'Silly Seal'. One day, Stan said to me, 'Why don’t you give him a little friend of some sort?' I had already created Ziggy Pig, who had his own little feature, so it was quite easy to combine them into one series. I said, 'How about Ziggy Pig?' Stan said, 'Okay!' I should add that, while I created Ziggy Pig, it was Stan who named him.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Al Jaffee (interviewee)| title=[Interview of Al Jaffee] |journal=[[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|volume= 3|number=35|date= April 2004}}</ref>}}

==Fictional character biographies==
Ziggy Pig and Silly Seal are a type of traditional comedy duo, the [[double act|straight man]] and the [[Stooge (comedian)|stooge]]. Ziggy, who wears a blue hat and a black and yellow sweater with a red "Z", is the slightly smarter of the two, with Silly, a white seal with a toboggan cap and a scarf, the bumbling but occasionally triumphant sidekick whose "help" results in humorous complications. The two often find themselves united on comic book covers against [[antagonist]] Toughy Cat.

==In other media==
The [[movie]] ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' features a scene in an [[ice cream parlor]] in which [[France|French]] [[emperor]] [[Napoleon]], snatched through time, is challenged to eat a massive [[ice cream]] concoction called a "Ziggy Pig". The crowd eggs him on with the chant, "Eat the Pig! /  Eat the Pig! / Ziggy, Ziggy, Ziggy Zig!" After he does so, Napoleon receives a badge depicting the [[Timely Comics]] character.

Ziggy Pig is unrelated to the title character of the [[children's literature|children's book]] ''Ziggy Piggy and the Three Little Pigs'', by [[Frank Asch]] (Kids Can Press, Ltd., 2001, {{ISBN|1-55074-913-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-55074-913-7}}), and to the piggy Ziggy in the children's book ''A Pig Tale'' by [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Brian Seth Hurst]], and [[Salvatore Murdocca|Sal Murdocca]] ([[Simon & Schuster]]  Children's Publishing, 1993, {{ISBN|0-671-78778-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-671-78778-3}}).
