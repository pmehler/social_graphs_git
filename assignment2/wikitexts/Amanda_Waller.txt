'''Amanda Blake Waller''' ('''née White'''), also known as "'''the Wall'''", is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character first appeared in ''[[Legends (comics)|Legends]]'' #1 in 1986 and was created by [[John Ostrander]], [[Len Wein]], and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=322}}</ref> Amanda Waller is an antagonist and occasional ally to the [[superhero]]es of the [[DC Universe]], occasionally described as a [[supervillain]].

She is the director for the deadly missions of the [[Suicide Squad]] and a specialist who oversees research into [[metahuman|people with powers]]. Although she lacks superpowers herself, the character is a ruthless, high-ranking government official who uses guile, political connections, and sheer intimidation to achieve her goals, often in the name of national security. Waller is commonly associated with the fictional government agencies [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] and [[A.R.G.U.S.]]

In recent years, the character has been substantially adapted into animated and live-action media. Several actresses have voiced or portrayed the character: [[C. C. H. Pounder]] for various animated projects; [[Pam Grier]] on the live-action series ''[[Smallville]]''; [[Angela Bassett]] in the live-action film ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]''; [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] in the animated series ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''; [[Cynthia Addai-Robinson]] in the live-action series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''; [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] in the franchise ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]''; and [[Viola Davis]] in the [[DC Extended Universe]] films ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'', and ''[[Black Adam (film)|Black Adam]]'', as well as the [[HBO Max]] series ''[[Peacemaker (TV series)|Peacemaker]]''.

==Publication history==
The people most responsible for shaping the character in her earliest appearances were [[John Ostrander]] and [[Kim Yale]], in the pages of the ''[[Suicide Squad]]'' series in the late 1980s.

Nicknamed "the Wall", she is a former congressional aide and government agent often placed in charge of the [[Suicide Squad]], a semi-secret government-run group of former supervillains working in return for amnesty. She later served as Secretary of [[Metahuman]] Affairs under President [[Lex Luthor]], before being arrested in the wake of Luthor's public fall from grace. Waller was reassigned to the leadership of [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] as White Queen, but was forced to resign because of her involvement in Operation [[Salvation Run]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Early history===
[[File:Amanda Waller (circa 1990).png|thumb|left|Amanda Waller in ''Who's Who in the DC Universe'' #1 (August 1990). Art by Luke McDonnell and Geof Isherwood.]]
Amanda Waller has been established as a widow who escaped [[Chicago]]'s [[Cabrini–Green]] housing projects with her surviving family after one of her sons, one of her daughters and her husband were murdered.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |last2=Pasko |first2=Martin |title=The Essential Superman Encyclopedia |date=2010 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=978-0-345-50108-0 |pages=465–466}}</ref> Waller excelled in political science and became a congressional aide. During that time, she discovered the existence of the first two incarnations of the Squad. Taking elements from both of these, she proposed the development of its third incarnation to the White House and was placed in charge upon its approval.

===Federal service years===
The [[List of government agencies in DC Comics#The Agency|Agency]] was formed by Amanda Waller to serve as a small, quasi-independent branch of [[Suicide Squad|Task Force X]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberger |first1=Robert |title=The Essential Batman Encyclopedia |date=2008 |publisher=Del Rey |isbn=9780345501066 |pages=365–366}}</ref> [[Valentina Vostok]] brought former [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant [[Harry Stein (comics)|Harry Stein]] into the Agency as an operative. Amanda Waller later promoted Stein to the command position and demoted Vostok. Harry Stein would later reorganize the Agency and name it [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]].

Waller's tenure as the official in charge of the third Suicide Squad was tumultuous and controversial. Despite many successes, she developed a habit of defying her superiors in Washington in order to achieve goals both legitimate and personal on more than one occasion. The earliest conflict between her and her superiors revolved around the leadership of the Suicide Squad. Although she proposed the [[Bronze Tiger]], the man she had helped out of his brainwashing, lead the team he was instead relegated to second-in-command, and [[Rick Flag|Rick Flag Jr.]] was made the leader. Waller resentfully presumed the situation to be racially charged, related to not only her own status as a black woman, but also Bronze Tiger's own skin tone, although the Tiger himself did not believe this was a factor, instead believing this was a result of mistrust due to the brainwashing imposed upon him by the League of Assassins.

Her relationship with the Squad itself was one of mutual dislike. Most of the team's criminal members did not really take to Waller's methods (most notably [[Captain Boomerang]]), and even the team's heroes were often at odds with Waller. Waller's inability to deal and compromise with her troops led to [[Nemesis (DC Comics)|Nemesis]]'s departure from the team and the death of a US senator, which indirectly caused the death of Rick Flag Jr. Those type of conflicts, however, were not only limited to her superiors and her team, but also extended to [[Batman]], who opposed the forming of the Suicide Squad (although he would later help to reform it). Nonetheless, the team remained loyal to her, often choosing to side with her instead of the government.

It was ultimately revealed the reason Amanda Waller kept the heroes such as [[Nightshade (DC Comics)|Nightshade]] around, was in order for them to act as her conscience. Over the course of her first run with the Suicide Squad, her actions became increasingly erratic as she fought to retain control of the Squad. This was heightened by the public revelation of the Suicide Squad, and her being officially replaced, although her 'replacement' was in fact an actor, and Waller remained the team's director.

Even that secret would eventually be revealed and Amanda Waller would be put on trial. During this time, the Squad also became involved in an interagency conflict in a crossover between the ''Checkmate'' and ''Suicide Squad'' titles called the [[Janus Directive]].

One of the field missions is against her will, as many members of the Squad, Waller included, are forcibly kidnapped and taken to [[Apokolips]]. This is because team member Duchess remembered her past as [[Lashina]] of the [[Female Furies]], instead of being amnesiac as she pretended, and wished to return home with suitable sacrifices. The Squad suffers fatalities battling Apokolips' forces, with Waller personally confronting [[Granny Goodness]]. However, the confrontation ended with the deaths of Dr. Light and one of Waller's own nieces, and Count Vertigo near-fatally wounded.

She eventually found herself serving prison time for her pursuit of an organized crime cartel based in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] called the LOA and killing its leadership, using Squad operatives Ravan, Poison Ivy and Deadshot in the process.

===The Suicide Squad's rebirth===
Waller is eventually pardoned and released a year later to reorganize the Suicide Squad as a freelance mercenary group at the behest of [[Sarge Steel]] to deal with a crisis in [[Vlatava (comics)|Vlatava]], [[Count Vertigo]]'s home country; Waller allowed herself to enter prison because she knew two things perfectly well: one, by confronting the LOA with Squad operatives, she had crossed the line, and two, she would return to her position quite easily if she was ever needed again. Afterwards, the Suicide Squad performs a variety of missions, often treading dangerous political terrain when dealing with Soviet and Israeli interests. Most notably, the Squad help destroy the plans of a shadow organization to throw Qurac, Israel and the US into political disarray.

During the course of her renewed tenure with this team, Amanda became closer to her operatives, even accompanying them on their field missions. This allows for her and her team to bond more effectively, although she retains her dominant and threatening personality.

Waller quits after a later field mission, in which she personally takes down the seemingly immortal dictator of a small, South American island nation. As it turned out, he wasn't immortal, but had an immense amount of psychic power, and by tricking him, Waller merely provided a form of assisted suicide.

Soon after, Amanda Waller organizes the [[Shadow Fighters]] to confront the villain [[Eclipso]]. Again, she would confront Sarge Steel. Her first attempt at a team, formed with the assistance of [[Eclipso|Bruce Gordon]] and his wife Mona, did not go well. Most of the team are brutally murdered infiltrating Eclipso's stronghold. Her second attempt with a much larger team has much more success.

During the [[Bloodlines (comics)|Bloodlines]] debacle, the President sends [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]] to fetch Waller from her island 'retirement'. She leads a multi-hero affair that results in the destruction of the alien parasites.<ref>''Bloodbath'' #1-2 (December 1993)</ref> She rejoins federal service, initially as Southeastern regional director for the [[Department of Extranormal Operations]]. She is promoted to Secretary of Metahuman Affairs as a member of the [[Lex Luthor]] Presidential Administration.

===International service===
Lex Luthor's brief tenure in office leads to Amanda Waller being jailed. This does not last long. She is released by Luthor's successor Jonathan Vincent Horne, who orders her to take command of the secret agent organization [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]]. The organization had been shaken up due to [[The OMAC Project]] debacle and the related murderous leadership of [[Maxwell Lord]] whom Waller has had previous history with. Waller takes the rank of Black King until the United States and United Nations decide what to do with that organization. In the latter issues of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', Waller is shown commissioning the imprisoned [[Albert Rothstein|Atom Smasher]] to organize a new Suicide Squad to attack [[Black Adam]] and his allies. This ends with the death of Squad member [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]] and the expected public relations turn against the Black Marvel family.

In the revamped ''Checkmate'' series set in the [[One Year Later]] continuity, Waller is shown to have been assigned by the UN to serve as Checkmate's White Queen, a member of its senior policy-making executive. Due to her previous activities, her appointment is contingent on her having no direct control over operations.<ref>''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #6</ref> Regardless, she continues to pursue her own agenda, secretly using the Suicide Squad to perform missions in favor of American interests<ref>''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #7</ref> and blackmailing [[Fire (comics)|Fire]].<ref>''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #5</ref> It is also implied that she may have betrayed a mission team in an attempt to protect her secrets<ref>''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #18</ref> and facilitated an attack on Checkmate headquarters for her own gain.<ref name="C20">''Checkmate'' vol. 2 #20</ref>

[[File:Amanda Waller (circa 2006).png|thumb|upright|Amanda Waller as the White Queen in promotional art for ''Checkmate''. Art by Jesus Saiz.]]
She then is in charge of Operation [[Salvation Run]], an initiative involving the mass deportation of supervillains to an alien world. When this was discovered by the rest of Checkmate, she was forced into resigning as White Queen in exchange for their delay in revealing what the US government was doing.<ref name="C20"/> She continues to run the Suicide Squad, and has been implanted with nanotechnology to allow her to directly control [[Chemo (comics)|Chemo]] during missions.<ref name="C20"/>

During the [[Superman/Batman]] storyline "K", it is revealed that Waller has hoarded [[Kryptonite]] and used it to power an anti-Superman group called the Last Line, and a [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]-like creature codenamed "All-American Boy", who has Kryptonite shards growing out of his body. All-American Boy, (real name: Josh Walker) was deceived into an experiment to use Kryptonite to bond cell scrapings taken from Doomsday to a human host, battles Superman, devastating [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]] in the process. Batman, with the help of Brannon, the Last Line's leader, locate Josh's parents who convince him to stop. Waller is forced to pay towards repairing Smallville in return for her dealings in the AAB project to remain secret. 'Last Line' itself rebels against Waller because of her deceptions.<ref>''Superman/Batman'' #44-49 (2008)</ref>

In the eight-issue series of ''Suicide Squad: Raise the Flag'', she is again seen leading the Suicide Squad at some point when the General returned to Earth after his exile, and was promptly drafted into the Squad with special explosive implants grafted into his arm and brain to make him compliant with Waller's demands. Here, she personally uses technology devised by Cliff Carmichael to gain a measure of control over Chemo, allowing her to use the toxic behemoth for the Squad's benefit. Rick Flag is revealed to have survived the events at Jotunheim and was returned to Waller, who revealed to him Rick Flag Jr. was never anything but an alias, and that he was in reality a brainwashed soldier remade into Flag to serve Eiling's ends.

She leads, as Chemo, an attack on a Dubai supercorp intending to release a deadly virus. However, Carmichael, with Eiling and part of her team, betrays her as part of Eiling's plan to benefit from the release of the virus, and she is nearly killed when Eiling orders a compliant Flag to use her pen, actually a transmitter, to detonate her own explosive implant. Instead, Flag, tricking him, detonates Eiling's own, releasing her and ultimately rejoining the Squad, refusing the chance of a normal life.

She later attempted to forcibly return several members of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]] (Bane and Deadshot) into the Suicide Squad, and when her plan backfired due to the events of [[Blackest Night]] and the defiance of the Six, she was shot by Deadshot and privately revealed to [[King Faraday]] to be their new secret leader, Mockingbird. When Faraday questioned the need to be informed of the situation, and even the need to bring the Six under the banner of the Squad when she already controlled them, Amanda merely shrugged it off, stating "her left and right hand only knew what the other was thinking" in a strict need-to-know basis, implying Faraday will one day need that knowledge.

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Amanda Waller is shown to be in direct command of the [[Suicide Squad]], choosing its members and having final say over when and if their implanted explosives are detonated. It is revealed she requested a command of a unit she could send to their deaths without regret after an operation she was involved in resulted in the death of all other squad members, including several she had personally recruited. She was also involved with [[Team 7]] in some capacity while serving in the [[United States Army]] as a [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]], which led to her temporarily leaving the spy business. Also, this version of Amanda Waller is re-imagined as a young, thin woman in contrast with her original design.

Amanda Waller later formed the Justice League of America that is separate from the main Justice League where she is shown as the Director of [[A.R.G.U.S.]]<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #1</ref> She recruited James Gordon Jr. who was alive despite his apparent death at the hands of his sister Barbara while saving their mother. However, it is shown that James Jr. only agreed to join as he is in love with Waller.

During the "[[Forever Evil]]" storyline, Amanda Waller is shown at Belle Reve trying to get [[Black Manta]] to join the Suicide Squad at the time when Deathstorm and [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]] infiltrate the prison.<ref>''Forever Evil'' #1</ref> Amanda Waller later contacts Deadshot in order to get the Suicide Squad back together.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #7.1</ref> Later clues point to an imposter Amanda Waller causing trouble behind the scenes.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' vol. 4 #27 (Jan. 2014)</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
Amanda Waller returns to her original design with the [[DC Rebirth]] initiative. When confronted by [[Barack Obama]] about Task Force X, she convinces him the Suicide Squad needs to exist to deal with threats neither the President or the [[Justice League]] can be aware of, while conceding to nominate a non-criminal field leader to carry out her directives during missions and keep the convicts in line. She visits [[Rick Flag]] in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], where he had been imprisoned for disobeying direct instructions in order to save his teammates, and tries to convince him to work alongside supervillains for a greater good; she succeeds, releases him and makes him the field leader of Task Force X.<ref>''Suicide Squad: Rebirth'' (August 2016)</ref>

In issue #11 of ''Suicide Squad'' (2016), as a part of DC Rebirth, Amanda Waller is shot and killed. Her death is confirmed in issue #12. However, it is revealed in issue #15 she faked her death with the help of Deadshot, who fired a bullet at her heart, and Enchantress, who magically moved the bullet to the most reparable part of the human heart. Because of this, she is able to use Deadshot against the villain Rustam and the international shadow organization known only as the People.

[[Image:Amanda waller.JPG|thumb|upright|Amanda Waller in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]
* Amanda Waller appears in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', voiced by [[C. C. H. Pounder]]. This version of the character leads the secret [[Project Cadmus]] at the United States government's behest to create a counter-force to the [[Justice League]] should they go rogue like their [[Justice Lords|alternate reality counterparts]]. Under her watch, Cadmus created the [[Super Friends|Ultimen]], [[Power Girl|Galatea]], and [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. Originally distrustful of the League, Waller frequently deals with [[Batman]] (which forms most of the interaction between Cadmus and the League). In "Ultimatum", she reveals that she knows that Bruce Wayne is Batman. In "The Doomsday Sanction", Batman discovers her identity to which Amanda presents the threat the League would pose if they went rogue. Waller is a central character during the Cadmus four-part finale arc when the [[Question (comics)|Question]] discovers Cadmus files and then is captured by Luthor, Waller orders Dr. Moon to interrogate. Shortly after Question is rescued by Superman and the [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Huntress]], Luthor momentarily hijacked the Justice League's binary fusion cannon to obliterate Waller's Cadmus and implicate the League. In response, Waller sends an army of mass-produced Ultimen clones under Galatea's control against the expended Justice League and has Galatea overload their enemy's reactor with the team inside. While watching the satellite, Batman presents Waller with evidence of Luthor's deception. Upon realizing that Luthor betrayed her, she calls off the attack on the Watchtower and has the Justice League accompany her to attempt to stop Luthor's plan. In the episode "Epilogue", [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] seeks out an aged Waller to find out about his true past. Waller reveals that she was responsible for the Batman Beyond Project to have Batman's future replacement as she had come to respect and admire the hero, and was aware of the possibility that he would eventually retire as he aged. Although she gave up on her original plan, after the [[Andrea Beaumont|Phantasm]], Bruce's ex-fiancée talked her out of it she encourages Terry to take care of his [[Dana Tan|own loved ones]].
* Amanda Waller appears in ''[[Smallville]]'', portrayed by [[Pam Grier]]. Introduced in the [[Smallville (season 9)|ninth season]] two-hour episode "[[Absolute Justice]]", this version is a ranking agent of both [[Checkmate (comics)|Checkmate]] and the Suicide Squad. It's noted by several characters that Waller would end up causing conflict in her paranoia to be ready for a fight. In the episode "Checkmate", Waller captures [[Martian Manhunter]] in the agency's headquarters after failing to kidnap and recruit [[Green Arrow]] for the government. In the episode "Sacrifice", Waller is working with Stuart Campbell (aka the White Knight) to track down [[Tess Mercer]] to lead Checkmate to the Kandorians, leading to a confrontation with [[General Zod|Major Zod]]. Waller is presumed dead in the [[Smallville (season 10)|tenth season]], as Flag is seen acting on his own to "protest" the Vigilante Registration Act. 
[[File:Amanda Waller (Cynthia Addai-Robinson).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Cynthia Addai-Robinson]] as Waller in the television series ''Arrow'']]
* Amanda Waller appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', voiced by [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]]. This version was the warden of Belle Reve. In the episode "Terrors", after she failed to stop a breakout, she was replaced by [[Hugo Strange]]. She returns in the episode "Leverage", where she has formed the Suicide Squad from Rick Flag, Black Manta, Captain Boomerang, and [[Monsieur Mallah]]. Waller sent them on a mission to Russia to eliminate the [[Rocket Red Brigade]] before they can be formed. However, they're foiled in their mission by the Team. When the Suicide Squad is returned to Belle Reve, Waller reveals them as her special ops team and voices her knowledge of the Team's formation. She threatens [[Aqualad (Kaldur'ahm)|Aquaman II]] with exposing his "little play-group" (referring to "the Team") if he exposes the Suicide Squad.
* Amanda Waller appears in ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', portrayed by [[Cynthia Addai-Robinson]]. This version is the Director of A.R.G.U.S., making her first appearance in the [[Arrow (season 2)|second season]] episode "Keep Your Enemies Closer". She had John Diggle abducted as she needs him and the Arrow's help in retrieving [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Lyla Michaels]] from Russia (who was searching for [[Deadshot|Floyd Lawton]] to retrieve him as well), and is aware that [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] is Arrow. She later appears briefly in the episode "Tremors" talking to [[Bronze Tiger]] after the latter returns to prison. She offers him a position on her unit, heavily hinted to be the Suicide Squad, to reduce his sentence and because she needs someone of his talents for her squad. In the episode "Suicide Squad", Waller assembles the team (consisting of Deadshot, Bronze Tiger, Michaels, [[Shrapnel (DC Comics)|Shrapnel]] and Diggle) to destroy a biological weapon in Markovia. It is implied that Waller first met Oliver (as they're on a first-name basis) during the latter's time as a castaway along with [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/exclusive-amanda-waller-unleashes-the-suicide-squad-on-arrow/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Amanda Waller Unleashes the Suicide Squad on "Arrow" |last=Narcisse|first=Evan|publisher=Comic Book Resource|date=February 21, 2014}}</ref> She is seen again in the episode "City of Blood" where Diggle and Felicity ask for her to help them find Oliver having gone missing after his mother's death, and traces Oliver down for them. In the following episode "Streets of Fire", Waller is shown to be preparing to bomb Starling City to contain Slade's Mirukuru army. After Oliver reveals to her that he has the cure for the Mirukuru, she gives Oliver until dawn to stop Slade and his army. In the episode "Unthinkable", Waller calls off the drone from bombing the city after Slade's defeat. In the final scene in a flashback, she rescues and recruits Oliver in Hong Kong. Throughout the beginning of the [[Arrow (season 3)|third season]], flashbacks explore how Waller attempts to get Oliver to cooperate and train to become a valuable asset of A.R.G.U.S. and has to use blackmail and other tactics to ensure his loyalty and commitment to training. She sends Oliver and Maseo Yamashiro to get the Alpha-Omega virus from China White and her Triad to prevent bids for buyers. After they succeed, a military general [[Creature Commandos|Matthew Shrieve]] goes rogue and begins to kill anyone in Hong Kong with a bioweapon, including killing Amanda as well, but is saved from Oliver and Maseo. In the present-day episode, "Suicidal Tendencies", Waller sends the Suicide Squad (including John and Lyla) to Kaznia to extract US senator Joseph Cray from terrorists who are holding him hostage, but this was revealed as a ruse by Cray. When Lyla persuaded Waller to admit the truth of this mission to the world, she refused it, which leaves Lyla and John bitter about her leadership and her mannerisms. She is shot in the head and killed in the [[Arrow (season 4)|fourth season]] episode "A.W.O.L." when A.R.G.U.S. is infiltrated by the criminal paramilitary organization [[Shadowspire]] after Waller confirms that she cannot be forced to give Shadowspire access to any information from A.R.G.U.S. records, including its Rubicon protocol. Waller also appears briefly in flashbacks when she sends Oliver on Lian Yu to investigate a drug harvesting operation by Shadowspire (under the leadership of [[Baron Blitzkrieg|Baron Reiter]]), but is revealed to be a finding a mystical object who would later appear in the present day. Lyla Michaels later becomes Waller's successor, and works to reform A.R.G.U.S. through such acts as disbanding Task Force X, although she keeps criminals such as [[King Shark]] locked up for security purposes.
* Amanda Waller appears in season 3 of [[HBO Max]]'s adult animated series ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', voiced by [[Tisha Campbell]]. Debuting in "Harlivy", Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy bump into her after springing [[Clayface]] and [[King Shark]] from Arkham Asylum where she claims that Poison Ivy hasn't done anything evil in years.

* Amanda Waller appears in ''[[Batman: Assault on Arkham]]'', with C. C. H. Pounder reprising her role. Set in the universe of the ''[[Batman: Arkham]]'' video games, she is shown in a rather negative light, sending the Suicide Squad in a smoke screen mission whose only real purpose is killing [[Riddler]], as the villain knows how to defuse the Suicide Squad's implanted bombs. At the end of the movie, she is warned by Batman to avoid activating the Suicide Squad in the future and dismisses his warning, challenging him to try and denounce her. She finds a laser dot from [[Deadshot]]'s gun on her in the final scene, but, as revealed in ''[[Batman: Arkham Underworld]]'', Batman prevented Deadshot from ultimately carrying out the assassination.
* An alternate version of Amanda Waller appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Penny Johnson Jerald]].
