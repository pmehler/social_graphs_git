'''Forever People''' are a fictional group of extraterrestrial [[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. They first appeared in ''Forever People'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d February&ndash;March 1971), and were created by [[Jack Kirby]] as part of his "[[Fourth World (comics)|Fourth World]]" epic.<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=113}}</ref>

==Publication history==
The protagonists of the series are a group of young [[New Gods]] from [[New Genesis]] who were on a mission to oppose [[Darkseid]] on Earth, and talked, dressed, and acted much like the [[flower child]]ren of the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|author-link = Les Daniels|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|chapter= The Fourth World New Gods on Newsprint|publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company|Bulfinch Press]]|year = 1995|location= New York, New York|page = 164|isbn = 0821220764|quote= Immigrants from New Genesis to Earth, these heroes were Kirby's version of hippies.}}</ref> In addition to the individual abilities and equipment of the members, the group can join together using the technology of a [[Mother Box]] to summon the powerful hero known as the [[Infinity-Man]].<ref name="dc-ency">{{Citation|last= Greenberger|first= Robert|author-link= Robert Greenberger|contribution = Forever People|editor-last= Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 130|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|isbn = 978-0-7566-4119-1|oclc = 213309017}}</ref> The group travels by use of their Super-Cycle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foreverp.htm |title=The Forever People |first=Don |last=Markstein |year=2008 |publisher=[[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6QpOv3xjF?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/foreverp.htm |archive-date=July 5, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first issue of their title also introduced the [[Boom Tube]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sacks |first1=Jason |last2=Dallas |first2=Keith |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: The 1970s |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490564 |page=38}}</ref>

In a 1986 interview Kirby recalled, "The Forever People were the wonderful people of the ’60s, who I loved. If you’ll watch the actions of the Forever People, you’ll see the reflection of the ’60s in their attitudes,
in the backgrounds, in their clothes. You’ll see the ’60s. I felt I would leave a record of the ’60s in their adventures."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/effect/2012/08/06/19867-kirby-interview/ | title=1986/7 Jack Kirby Interview | date=6 August 2012 }}</ref>

In 1988, a six-issue ''Forever People'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] by writer [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and artist [[Paris Cullins]] was published,<ref>{{gcdb series|id= 3591|title= ''Forever People'' vol. 2}}</ref> showing what happens to the Forever People on Adon. This series reveals that the Forever People were Earth-born humans — infants doomed to die but brought to New Genesis instead, gathered to protect the human race. They returned to Earth to oppose 'the Darkness', a sentient but disembodied force of hopelessness. They were aided by a mysterious being Maya who is ultimately revealed to be the consciousness of their Mother Box.

During the events of ''[[Death of the New Gods]]'', one of the miniseries that attempted to lead into ''[[Final Crisis]]'', the human origin of the Forever People was [[retroactive continuity|retconned]], and it was hinted that the five were to have been the first of the next evolution of the New Gods — godlings becoming more than the sum of their parts. In the ''Death of the New Gods'', [[Superman]] and [[Mister Miracle]] discover that the Forever People were murdered several months prior to the discovery of their bodies, and it is later revealed that an impostor posing as [[Himon]] has been murdering the New Gods as an agent for [[Source (comics)|the Source]]; but the murderer turns out to be Infinity Man.

In the ''Final Crisis Sketchbook'', the Forever People (along with other members of the New Gods) are shown to be given updated looks, which [[Grant Morrison]] calls "more gothic art school student than flower power". In the event itself, Japan's pop culture team, the Super Young Team are revealed to be the Fifth World incarnation of the Forever People.<ref name="Schedeen">{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/11/dcs-forever-people-make-their-new-52-debut|title= DC's Forever People Make Their New 52 Debut|first= Jesse|last= Schedeen|date= March 11, 2014|website= [[IGN]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141217204646/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/11/dcs-forever-people-make-their-new-52-debut|archive-date= December 17, 2014|url-status=live|quote= The concept was most recently explored by Grant Morrison in ''Final Crisis'', who created the colorful Japanese group The Super Young Team to serve as the Forever People of the new Fifth World.}}</ref>

==Original members==
[[Image:ForeverPeople9.jpg|thumb|200px|Members of the Forever People, on the cover of issue #9 (June&ndash;July 1972). From top to bottom: Big Bear, Vykin the Black, Mark Moonrider, Beautiful Dreamer, Serifan.<br>Artists: Jack Kirby and Mike Royer]]

===Beautiful Dreamer===
During the original Kirby run, Beautiful Dreamer had been linked romantically to Mark Moonrider, although outside of hand-holding, the exact nature of their relationship was never directly specified. In the 1988 miniseries, it was established that Dreamer had been married to Big Bear, and together they had a child, named Maya after the spirit of their old [[Mother Box]]. Since then, their marriage and daughter has been voided by a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]] during [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s ''[[Fourth World (comics)|Jack Kirby's Fourth World]]'' series. When last shown, Dreamer was romantically involved with [[Takion]], the new Highfather of New Genesis.

In ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]] 3'', she marries Superman, and has his children, Lar-El and Vara. All three are killed by Darkseid.

====Powers and abilities====

Like all the children of New Genesis, Beautiful Dreamer possesses the advanced physiology of a New God; she is extremely long-lived, has a limited degree of superhuman strength, resistance and reflexes. She's a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. Also, she has psionic powers, with which she can create illusions. It seems there are no limits to the size or duration of these images. In addition, she has been able to feel the fluctuations within the Source.

===Big Bear===
Big Bear had been married to Beautiful Dreamer, and she had been pregnant with their daughter. A shift in time resulted in the marriage never happening and the child never having existed. This traumatized Beautiful Dreamer for a time. In ''Forever People'' #7, he was shown to have been responsible for the historical event that led to the legend of [[King Arthur]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Kirby, Jack|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= Royer, Mike|story= I'll Find You in Yesterday!!|title= The Forever People|issue= 7|date= February&ndash;March 1972}}</ref>

====Powers and abilities====
A skilled hand-to-hand combatant, Big Bear is among the strongest of the children of New Genesis, making him superstrong by human standards, capable of bending steel and hurling giant redwood trees almost effortlessly. Big Bear's atomic structure is reinforced by a constant flow of so-called high-density atoms, and he is able to store an excess of free-flowing atoms which he can direct at will to reinforce the power of his already awesome punch.

===Mark Moonrider===
During the original Kirby run, Beautiful Dreamer had been linked romantically to Mark Moonrider, although outside of hand-holding, the exact nature of their relationship was never directly specified. In the 1988 miniseries set on Adon, Mark was shown to have fallen in love with, and later married one of the natives, Mina. They had three children (Merry, Wendy and Starbright), but when the shift in time caused by the Darkness' actions undid the events which 'evolved' the natives, this marriage now never had occurred, leaving Mark with only his friends.

====Powers and abilities====
In addition to being extremely long-lived, Mark has superhuman strength, reflexes and he's very resistant to conventional injury. Also, he has a keen mind with good leadership skills and he is well-trained in hand-to-hand combat. He possesses a '''Megaton Touch'''. With it, he can cause a tremendous explosion, and no doubt he could easily kill with it if he and his companions were not sworn never to take a life. Used at low intensity, it can cause a severe shock. On one occasion he used his megaton touch to turn solid rock into molten lava.

===Serifan===
Serifan is the youngest member of the group. He's usually the most vulnerable. The Dark saw this and possessed Serifan, using him to conquer Forevertown and plague the Forever People. After the Dark was defeated he returned to his normal self.

====Powers and abilities====
Although Serifan doesn't have super-potencies, still he is stronger and more durable than any human. Also, Serifan is functionally a sensitive possessing limited telepathic powers. In his hatband Serifan carries "cosmic cartridges" that serve various purposes when wielded. For example, the cartridges can be used to create protective shock-repelli-fields, drain energy from people, create an anti-gravity effect or generate high gravitational force, modify atomic density, generate intense heat, power vehicles or to stun an opponent. Also, the cartridges tune the wielder into the "cosmic Harmony" that is linked to [[The Source (comics)|the Source]] and, in the case of the "Blue Cartridge", it manipulates the life force and allowed [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] to merge with a "Follower" and have a body of his own once again.

===Vykin===
Throughout the Kirby run, Vykin was referred to as "Vykin the Black". He was the first [[Black people|black]] superhero to appear in a DC comic book, preceding Kirby's [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] by approximately seven months. When the Forever People were stranded on Adon, Mark Moonrider thought it would be advantageous to civilize the people of the planet. When Vykin used their [[Mother Box]] to do so, it overloaded and was destroyed, killing Vykin in the process, but managing to create '''Forevertown'''. When the Dark overtook and reversed the effects of the Mother Box, Vykin was brought back to life. Recently he was reunited on New Genesis with his mother, Valkyra the Commander, who rode a winged robotic horse. Later on, she sacrificed her life to save her lover [[Orion (comics)|Orion]].

====Powers and abilities====
Like all New gods, Vykin The Black is functionally immortal and all his physical attributes are superhuman. Also, Vykin The Black possesses "Magno-Power", which enables him to project magnetic energy. He can mentally trace atomic patterns, and is therefore good at tracking. He has an intuitive grasp of the workings of complicated machinery. Vykin has a keen mind and he's a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. It is Vykin who carries the Forever People's Mother Box, a kind of [[sentience|sentient]] computer.

===Infinity-Man===
[[Infinity-Man]] is Drax, the older brother of Uxas, who would later become [[Darkseid]] of Apokolips, and became the Infinity-Man after treachery at the hands of Uxas while attempting to harness the '''Omega Force''' for himself. No explanation was given as to why he was involved with the Forever People other than Big Bear's offhanded comment to [[Superman]] in the first issue of "we've got an arrangement with the Infinity Man". The Infinity-Man's powers were never fully cataloged other than having some direct link to [[The Source (comics)|the Source]]. He was shown capable of flight, super-strength, enhanced vision powers, and the ability to negate gravity and convert it into a repulsive force.

==Fifth World==
{{Main|Super Young Team}}
The [[Super Young Team]] are the contemporary Fifth World incarnations of the Forever People.<ref name="Schedeen" /> Created by writer [[Grant Morrison]] in the early "52" stages of their DC Universe ''[[Final Crisis]]'' storyline, they are influenced by American super-heroes and Japanese pop culture, and were first mentioned in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' #6. This group recruits Sunny Sumo, a powerful fighter who assisted the original Forever People in the first series.<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Kirby, Jack| penciller= Kirby, Jack| inker= Colletta, Vince| story= Sonny Sumo| title= The Forever People| issue= 5| date= October&ndash;November 1971}}</ref>

==Other versions==

===Amalgam Comics===
The [[Un-People]] are a superhero group in the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe. They are a combination of the Forever People and [[Marvel Comics]]' the [[Inhumans]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer=  [[Karl Kesel|Kesel, Karl]]|penciller= [[Tom Grummett|Grummett, Tom]]|inker= [[Al Vey|Vey, Al]]|story= Challengers of the Fantastic|title= [[List of Amalgam Comics characters|Challengers of the Fantastic]]|issue= 1|date= June 1997}}</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Forever People appear in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Twilight" Pt. 2.
* The Forever People appear in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' episode "Disordered" with Vykin voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], Big Bear voiced by [[Bill Fagerbakke]], Beautiful Dreamer voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]], and Mark Moonrider and Serifan voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]. They arrived on Earth in order to reclaim the "New Genisphere" (the same sphere that the Bialyans found) where they run into Superboy and Wolf. They learn that Superboy had saved the New Genisphere. Superboy and the Forever People end up arriving at a nearby construction site where they stumble upon Intergang in the middle of a gold theft. The group witness Intergang using technology from Apokolips. Upon bringing their fight to the surface, the Forever People summon Infinity-Man who repels Intergang. When Superboy and the Forever People find a warehouse containing the weapons from Apokolips, they are ambushed by Desaad of Apokolips. During the Forever People's formation of Infinity-Man, Desaad throws a Father Box into the formation in order to control him. Desaad then has Infinity-Man attack Superboy and Wolf. With help from the New Genisphere, Superboy reclaims control of Infinity-Man. After Desaad retreats, the Forever People place the Mother Box in the New Genisphere to heal it and tell Superboy that they must take the New Genisphere to New Genesis. After an outburst from Superboy, and positive feedback from the Sphere itself, the Forever People let the New Genisphere stay with him. Big Bear returns in the third season. There are implications of a falling out between Big Bear and Beautiful Dreamer. Beautiful Dreamer appears in the episode "Quiet Conversations" explaining that they will need [[Metron (comics)|Metron's]] chair to fix Victor Stone. The Forever People appear in the fourth season. Big Bear has also made up with Dreamer.

===Film===
* An alternative universe version of Mark Moonrider makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]''. He participated in the massacre of the Apokoliptians during the wedding of Bekka and Orion.
