The UK version was published by Titan Magazines from March 2010 to August 2014, lasting for 55 issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://titanmagazines.com/t/batman-brave-bold/ |title=Batman the Brave and the Bold @ Titan Magazines |accessdate=2011-05-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217131223/http://titanmagazines.com/t/batman-brave-bold/ |archivedate=17 February 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> It reprinted comic strips previously featured in the original American comic book but also added extra content including puzzles, profiles and other special features. Because of these extra features, the short opening scenes from the comic strips were sometimes cut. However, this did not affect the over-all story, as the opening scenes were usually unrelated to the main story. A free gift was also added. It was [[Titan Magazines]]' third [[Batman]] comic alongside ''[[Batman Legends]]'' and ''[[DC Universe Presents Batman Superman]]'' and was the first to be aimed at a younger audience.
