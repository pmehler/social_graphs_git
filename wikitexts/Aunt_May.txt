'''Maybelle "May" Parker-Jameson''' (née '''Reilly'''), commonly known as '''Aunt May''', is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], commonly in association with the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. Making her first full appearance in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15 (August [[1962 in comics|1962]]), the character was created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]], playing an influential role in the Spider-Man comic books.

May is the [[widow]] of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] and the paternal aunt of Peter Parker, who leads a secret life as Spider-Man. She is nurturing and supportive of Peter as a [[mother figure]], although throughout most of Spider-Man's history, she has not known of his secret life and considered Spider-Man frightening. In modern renditions, May has been known to support the hero and in rare cases is aware that he is her nephew or at least suspecting his identity as Peter. Later in life, she marries [[List of Marvel Comics characters: J|J. Jonah "Jay" Jameson Sr.]], the estranged father of Peter's boss and Spider-Man's harshest critic [[J. Jonah Jameson]], making him her step-son and by extension Peter's step-cousin (and self-declared step-brother); much to Jameson's discomfort.

Since May's conception, the character has appeared in several media adaptations of Spider-Man, often playing a supporting role. May was portrayed by [[Rosemary Harris]] in [[Sam Raimi]]'s [[Spider-Man (2002 film series)|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]], [[Sally Field]] in [[Marc Webb]]'s [[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film series)|''The Amazing Spider-Man'' duology]] and [[Marisa Tomei]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films. The character was voiced by [[Lily Tomlin]] in the 2018 animated film, ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
May Parker (née Reilly) was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York on May 5.<ref>The 2007 [[Free Comic Book Day]] edition of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.</ref> After the death of her [[Richard and Mary Parker|brother-in-law and his wife]], May and her husband [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]] took in their only nephew, Peter, and raised him at their home in the [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] section of [[Queens]], having previously cared for [[mermaid]] Linda Brown by the beachside in their earlier years.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Manning|first1 = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 14|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= While the finished version of this duo wouldn't debut for another few months, their prototypes took center stage in a short story in the ''Strange Tales'' anthology called 'Goodbye to Linda Brown'...This particular May and Ben lived by the sea and were the caretakers of their young wheelchair user niece named Linda Brown.}}</ref> She remained an important influence in Peter's life even during college as she was the only family he had left. Her continued belief that Peter was still the fragile boy he had been before he gained his powers could be frustrating at times.

In the early years of his superhero career, Peter feared for May's well-being and the fatal shock that he believed would end her life if she ever learned about his dual identity as Spider-Man. Consequently, Peter often felt anguish over dealing with major crises while his aunt needed nearly constant care. This conflict took on an unusual turn when May became sweethearts with his enemy, Otto Octavius (also known as [[Doctor Octopus]]), and Peter struggled to deal with his enemy's schemes while not hurting his aunt.

During a period of convalescence at a nursing home, May met wheelchair user Nathan Lubensky. Gradually, May and Nathan fell in love with each other.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=198}}</ref> She invited Nathan into her Forest Hills home after converting it into a boarding house, and the couple were briefly engaged. However, May's heart was broken when Nathan suffered a fatal heart attack while protecting her from being taken hostage by Adrian Toomes, the costumed villain known as the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #336 (Early August 1990)</ref> Some time thereafter, a guilt-stricken Toomes confronted May, begging her to forgive him for his role in Nathan's death. (Ironically, Nathan had befriended Toomes when the two briefly resided at the same nursing home). May refused to do so, stating that only God could provide the villain with the redemption he was seeking.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #186–188 (March–May 1992)</ref>

As part of a plan by Peter's arch-foe [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], May was replaced by a "genetically-altered actress" who impersonated her while May was held captive by villains until the actress died,<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City|publisher = [[Pocket Books]]|year = 2007|location = New York City|pages = 49–51|isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> Osborn returning May to Peter with a device planted inside her that would detonate a series of gene bombs if removed, decimating Earth. [[Mister Fantastic]] was able to disable the device without removing it, saving the world and May, who apparently retained no memory of her time in captivity. May finally learned about her nephew's secret life when she walked into his room after he had sustained a serious beating from the villain [[Morlun]],<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' vol. 2 #35, #38</ref> the two later talking about May's discovery as May came to accept her nephew's real life.

When Spider-Man joins the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], Peter, Aunt May, and [[Mary Jane Watson]] move into [[Stark Tower]] after May loses her house to a fire. During the [[Civil War (comics)|Superhero Civil War]], she and Mary Jane convince Peter to unmask himself in front of a press conference.<ref>''Civil War'' #2 (w)[[Mark Millar]] (a)Steve McNiven</ref> Later, she is targeted by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], but outwits the villain by feeding him [[Zolpidem|Ambien]]-filled oatmeal-raisin cookies.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #31</ref>

When Peter changes his mind about the [[Civil War (comic book)|Superhuman Registration Act]], he moves his family from Stark Tower to a motel. An assassin hired by [[Kingpin (comics)|the Kingpin]] tries to kill Peter, but hits May instead.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #538 (February 2007)</ref> Peter takes May to a hospital<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #539 (March 2007)</ref> where she lapses into a coma and is likely to die. However, Aunt May receives a radioactive blood transfusion from Peter, which he hoped would save her life due to his mutated healing factor.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #541 (May 2007)</ref>

The demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] offers to restore May's health in exchange for erasing Peter's marriage from history, and Peter and Mary Jane agree. May lives, and Spider-Man's identity is once again a secret.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #545 (November 2007)</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-01-09-spider-man-marriage_N.htm?se=yahoorefer|work=USA Today|title=Comic fans fume as Marvel erases Spidey-MJ marriage|first=David|last=Colton|date=July 7, 2009|access-date=April 25, 2010}}</ref>

At the beginning of ''[[Spider-Man: Brand New Day|Brand New Day]]'', May is doing volunteer work for a homeless shelter, run by Martin Li, the supervillain crime boss [[Mister Negative]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #552 (March 2008)</ref> At this point, her knowledge of Peter being Spider-Man was erased. During her work at the shelter, she met John Jonah "Jay" Jameson (the father of [[J. Jonah Jameson]]) and started a relationship with him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #591 (April 2009)</ref> The following issue, Peter caught the two of them in bed.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man' 2009">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #592 (April 2009)</ref> However, he approved of this relationship, mainly because Jay supports Spider-Man, who had previously saved his life,<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man' 2009"/> and saw through Norman Osborn as a thug who holds nothing but contempt for the people.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #595 (June 2009)</ref>

Jay walked with May in Central Park and asked her to marry him, and May accepted.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #597</ref> Despite Doctor Octopus' subconscious efforts to halt his former fiancé's wedding plans, May and Jay were reluctantly wedded by New York Mayor J. Jonah Jameson, who expressed displeasure at Peter calling them stepbrothers (due to May being his adoptive mother).<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #600 (July 2009)</ref>

Aunt May has several blood relatives that are still alive, including a sister named Jan. May's first cousins Sam and Julia are the children of her uncle Bill and his wife Claudia. Peter was attracted to Julia's daughter Alexa.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #36</ref> The Reilly family is currently staying in May's house.

Upon her return from her honeymoon, she stops by the FEAST offices, only to accidentally walk in on Martin Li, along with [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] torturing one of Mr. Negative's Inner Demons. Trying to escape, Li touches her with his corrupting touch. She then returns to meet her husband and Peter. When Jay suggests going somewhere nice for dinner, Aunt May sarcastically proceeds to insult Peter over his fluctuating jobs and his dependence on them, culminating with calling her nephew "One damn big disappointment". A heartbroken Peter runs off.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #618</ref> Peter returns, after a physically and mentally exhausting battle against the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], tries talking to Aunt May, looking for someone to help give him hope after seeing the death of Curt Connors' humanity. She still continues to act like a bad-tempered teenager and at first, rebuffs him. However, after seeing Peter clearly suffering mentally, she feels guilty and undergoes an intense mind battle, breaking the corruption, and is shown simply sitting next to Peter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #633</ref>

Prior to the events of ''[[Spider-Island]]'', after Martin Li's secret identity is exposed to the public, May and Jay formally announce their intention to leave New York for good, for their own safety, and move to Boston. Jay explains this was the result of all the recent major incidents towards them and their friends and family. They put May's old house up for sale and leave once the moving van is packed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #665</ref> After spending their last night in New York at Jay's apartment, the following day she and Jay head to an airport in New Jersey with Peter and Carlie and they say their goodbyes before flying off.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #666–667</ref> Following the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, when May and Jay are returning home to New York on their private jet, but the irresponsible superhero [[Alpha (Marvel Comics)|Alpha]] uses his powers without care in his battle with [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]] causes many aircraft to shut down. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] rescue everybody and Spider-Man saves his May and Jay from Jameson's malfunctioning private jet just before it crashes. Later Peter arrives at the hospital to see that his Aunt May and Jay are okay, although she has sustained minor nerve damage to her leg that will require the use of a cane for the rest of her life.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #694</ref> In ''[[The Superior Spider-Man]]'' storyline, Aunt May's leg is fully healed from operation and completion surgery with gratitude of [[Cardiac (comics)|Doctor Wirtham]].<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #24</ref>

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'', May and Jay became part of the [[Parker Industries]]'s foundation, a charity focused on providing help for the less fortunate and raise the quality of life wherever it could be possible.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #4</ref> However, her husband Jay had coughed up blood and collapsed.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #15</ref> Aunt May is heartbroken after her husband Jay had later died in the hospital.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #19</ref> Aunt May, Peter and J.

After Peter Parker had his doctorate revoked for [[Dying Wish|"copying" Doctor Octopus']] thesis and getting fired from the Daily Bugle, May confronted her nephew about his actions.

==Other versions==

===Original appearance===
Lee and Ditko introduced the character of "Aunt May" alongside "Uncle Ben" in the June 1962 issue of ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #97, four months before her ''Amazing Fantasy'' debut. In the story "Goodbye to Linda Brown," the characters are given no surname. They care for a young woman named Linda Brown who develops a sleepwalking habit, just like May and Ben used to have. When Linda sleepwalks to the sea in her wheelchair, she becomes a mermaid.<ref name="Strange Tales">{{Cite web |last=Seifert |first=Mark |date=2021-11-29 |title=Aunt May, Uncle Ben and the Prototypical Story of Strange Tales #97 |url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/aunt-may-uncle-ben-and-the-prototypical-story-of-strange-tales-97/ |access-date=2022-07-21 |website=Bleeding Cool}}</ref><ref name="Goodbye to Linda Brown">{{Cite comic |Artist=Steve Ditko |Writer=Stan Lee |Story=Goodbye to Linda Brown |url=https://read.marvel.com/#/book/52770 |Title=Stange Tales |Volume=1 |Issue=97 |Publisher=Marvel |accessdate=2022-07-21}}</ref>

===Golden Oldie===
May Parker was transformed by [[Galactus]] into the cosmically powered being '''Golden Oldie''' to serve as his [[Herald of Galactus|herald]]. Rather than lead him to populated worlds, Oldie discovered an extraterrestrial baker who bakes planet-sized [[Twinkies|snack cakes]] that sate Galactus's hunger. May's transformation is ultimately revealed as a dream. The issue, a parody of an old [[Hostess (brand)|Hostess]] snack cake advertising campaign, was part of Marvel's "Assistant Editors Month" series of humorous issues.<ref>''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #137</ref>

May also appeared as "Golden Oldie" (this time an Iron Man parody) as well as "The Astonishing Aunt Ant" and "Auntie Freeze" in an issue of ''What If?''.<ref>''What If?'' #34</ref>

===MC2===
In the alternate timeline known as [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]], May Parker's death in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #400 was valid. It was May who died in this continuum, rather than an actress.<ref>Letter page response from ''Spider-Girl'' #47</ref> Peter's daughter, May "Mayday" Parker, was named for her. Mayday became the super-heroine [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]] and met the original May when she found herself displaced in time, although Mayday makes no attempt to explain who she really was.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #10–11</ref>

When Spider-Girl was trapped in an illusion by her enemy, Misery, she was given encouragement from a familiar spirit. She recognised the spirit as being Aunt May.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #90</ref>

In the final arc of ''Amazing Spider-Girl'', Aunt May acts a spiritual advisor to May in order to help her grandniece reclaim her identity and save Peter from Norman Osborn. In this form, she initially appears as a younger version of herself, which prevents May from recognizing her. However, May finally figures it out when she sees Aunt May through her father's eyes.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Girl'' #30</ref>

===''Spider-Man: Life Story''===
In this continuity, the characters age naturally after Peter Parker became Spider-Man in 1962. Sometime before 1977, May married Otto Octavius, but she later divorced him due to his anger management problems. In the 1980s, Mary Jane struggles to take care of May as she shows early signs of dementia around the time Mary Jane and Peter's twins are born. It puts a further rift in Peter and Mary Jane's marriage as Peter refuses to put her in a senior's home while Mary Jane is sick of being the sole caretaker of May and their children. Mary Jane later leaves Peter and takes the twins with her as Peter looks after May. May later dies sometime before 1995. When Otto attempts to destroy Peter's mind in 2019, Peter uses a memory of May to convince Otto to stop fighting Spider-Man and accept his life's limitations. The conjured memory version of May has one final talk with Peter before he saves the world from Doctor Doom's reign at the cost of his life.<ref>''Spider-Man: Life Story'' #2-6</ref>

===''Spider-Verse''===
During the "''[[Spider-Verse]]''" storyline, there are different versions of Aunt May that are featured:

* {{anchor|Earth-14512}}An alternate Aunt May from Earth-14512 appears in a flashback along with her version of Uncle Ben. They are depicted as scientists and the ones who informed [[Peni Parker]] that she was the only person able to carry on the SP//dr project after her father, the original pilot, died in battle.

After her father died, she used spare parts to create a suit with four mechanical arms that allowed her to climb walls as well as web shooters. While attending a ball, the mayor was kidnapped by the [[Sinister Six|Six Men of Sinestry]], so she stepped in to stop them; making her debut as '''the [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Lady Spider (Earth-803)|Lady Spider]]'''. Though the villains manage to get the mayor's plans, she defeats them and forces them to retreat.<ref name="sv1">''Spider-Verse'' #1 (2014)</ref> Following this, she is recruited into the Spider-Army. The Inheritors attacked them, separating her from the rest, though she accompanied [[Spider-Man 2099]] to his dimension to fend off the Inheritor Daemos. They then traveled to Earth-13 before going back to her dimension to fix the [[Spider-Man (Japanese TV series)|Japanese Spider-Man's]] Leopardon before they piloted it into battle against the Inheritors in Loomworld.
* {{anchor|Earth-11}}Earth-11's May Parker is the aunt of Penelope Parker, who told her about the spider bite she received during an accident at Osborn Labs, how she developed spider-like abilities, and how she wanted to hide her powers so people would think she was normal. However, Aunt May convinced her niece being normal was overrated and that she should embrace what happened to her in order to help people.<ref name="sv1"/>
* {{anchor|Earth-3123}}On Earth-3123, Aunt May is known as '''Spider-Ma'am'''. She ended up getting bitten by the radioactive spider instead of Peter as she showed up to the science demonstration to give Peter his lunch. After revealing her identity to Ben and Peter, Peter develops web shooters and the two help May with her heroic activities on the sidelines.<ref>''What If'' #23</ref> During the events of ''Spider-Verse'', she and her family were confronted by [[Karn (comics)|Karn]] of the Inheritors. Sensing that he was too strong for her, she proposed to offer her life for the sake of her family, causing Karn to temporarily hesitate as she reminded him of his mother. He nearly killed her, but several multiversal Spider-Men intervened and convinced him to join them.<ref>''Spider-Verse Team-Up'' #3</ref> During the "[[Spider-Geddon]]" storyline, Spider-Ma'am joined the fight against the Inheritors. When the villains are defeated, Superior Spider-Man cloned them as babies. After talking with her husband, Spider-Ma'am agreed to take them in as foster children.<ref>''Spider-Geddon'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Spider-Geddon''===
During the "''[[Spider-Geddon]]''" storyline, an unidentified Earth has a Hispanic version of May who is unaware that her husband and nephew have spider powers after a blood transfusion saved Uncle Ben's life.<ref>''Edge of Spider-Geddon'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows''===
In this [[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|''Secret Wars'']] Warzone, when Peter is captured by Regent and his life is flashing before his eyes, one of his memories was him standing in front of Aunt May's open casket at her funeral, confirming that she died sometime before the events of the comic.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe Aunt May is based on writer Brian Michael Bendis' mother.<ref name=ComicBookResources9.30.11>Richards, Dave (September 30, 2011). [http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=34654 "COMMENTARY TRACK: Bendis on "Ultimate Comics Spider-Man" #2"].

She is the biological sister of Mary Parker, and wife to Ben Parker.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w); Bagley, Mark (p). ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Peter reveals his secret identity to May after he finds Gwen Stacy's clone at her old house, resulting in May evicting Peter from her home, as she despises Spider-Man. This coincides with the appearance of a man who appears to be Richard Parker, Peter's father.<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #99</ref> Peter learns that May had known this man, actually an artificially-aged clone of Peter, and she kept this secret from Peter to "protect him".<ref>''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #100</ref> After a long talk between Peter and his "father", [[Nick Fury]] and a team of [[Spider Slayers]] surround the Parker home, which triggers a transformation in Gwen, turning her into [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].

Although angry at the Ultimates for belittling Peter's accomplishments in life when attending her nephew's funeral, May is nevertheless comforted when she met some of the people that Peter had saved during his career as Spider-Man, one little girl even offering her a comforting hug as thanks for raising the man who saved her. After the funeral, May and Gwen decide to take up Tony Stark's offer to set themselves up for a new life in France.<ref>''Ultimate Fallout'' #6</ref>

However, following the emergence of [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|a new Spider-Man]], May and Gwen return to New York. Though Captain America threatens to arrest Miles' parents and expose his secret to them unless he retires the Spider-Man identity, May and Gwen are more supportive of Miles, and May gives him Peter's old web-shooters, along with the formula for the web-fluid, encouraging him to carry on Peter's legacy.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), David Marquez (a). "Divided We Fall Part Two" ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' v2, #14 (November 2012), Marvel Comics</ref>

During the ''[[Spider-Men]]'' miniseries, May and Gwen are back in the United States, presumably to oversee the selling of the Parker Residence and to finish Gwen's term at Midtown High. They encounter someone wearing a red-and-blue Spider-Man costume and believe he is a lunatic who is disrespecting Peter's memory. They become angry and threaten to call the police. When the person unmasks himself, they are stunned beyond belief to see the older, more mature Peter Parker, from the Marvel 616 universe.<ref>''Spider-Men'' #3</ref> She initially is unconvinced that this Peter is who he says he is, but both she and Gwen later realize he is being truthful when he knows Uncle Ben's admonishment about power and responsibility. May is greatly moved at realizing that she has now been given the chance for closure that she had missed when her Peter died, and concludes that she had made the right choices concerning her nephew, before the adult Peter is returned to his universe.<ref>Bendis, Brian Michael (w), Pichelli, Sara (p).
