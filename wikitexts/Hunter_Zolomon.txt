==Fictional character biography==
==={{anchor|Origins}}Origin and transformation into Zoom===
[[File:Hunterzolomon.png|alt=Hunter Zolomon|thumb|upright|left|200px|Hunter Zolomon as he initially appeared before his transformation as the villainous speedster Zoom. Art by Scott Kolins.]]
Hunter Zolomon had a troubled relationship with his parents who rarely spoke to each other or to him. On the day Hunter was to leave for college, his father was revealed to be a [[serial killer]] who had murdered six young girls and his mother before being gunned down by the police after refusing to surrender. Following this incident, Hunter became obsessed with understanding the criminal mind and went on to study [[criminology]] and [[psychology]] at college. He later joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.)]] with his girlfriend [[Ashley Zolomon|Ashley]] whom he soon married. The two specialized in apprehending low-level costumed criminals until Hunter inadvertently caused the death of Ashley's father; Hunter had mistakenly believed that a criminal they were after, the Clown, was incapable of using a gun.<ref name=f197/> The case also left him with a damaged knee, forcing him to use a cane to walk. Abandoned by Ashley and fired by the F.B.I., Hunter moved to [[Keystone City]] and became a [[Offender profiling|profiler]] in the police's Department of [[Metahuman]] Hostilities. Hunter soon befriended the Flash ([[Wally West]]) as his insight was critical in solving a number of cases, though Hunter resented being stuck behind a desk.

Hunter was severely injured during an attack by [[Gorilla Grodd]] at [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]], and was left paralysed from the waist down.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #193 (February 2003). DC Comics.</ref> He begged Wally to use the time-travelling [[cosmic treadmill]] in the [[Flash Museum]] to prevent the series of tragedies in his life from ever occurring. But Wally refused, not wanting to risk damaging the [[timestream]] and thus shattering their friendship. Hunter then broke into the museum and attempted to use the cosmic treadmill himself. The resulting explosion cured Hunter's paralysis and shifted his connection to time; he now had the ability to alter his personal timeframe, granting him super-speed.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #196 (May 2003). DC Comics.</ref>

Hunter came to the conclusion that Wally's refusal to help was because of never suffering a personal tragedy unlike [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. Hunter became the supervillain "Zoom" (aka the second "Reverse-Flash") to bring tragedy to Wally's life, believing that this was the only way to make the Flash a better hero. During an attempt to kill the pregnant [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]], Zoom created an electrical shockwave that caused Linda to [[miscarriage|miscarry]] their twins instead. Wally then forced Zoom into a temporal anomaly; Hunter was rendered [[coma]]tose and forced to relive his father-in-law's death repeatedly.

Zolomon's estranged wife Ashley replaced him as a profiler in the police department and attempted to communicate with him. When Ashley was hospitalized after a car accident, Zoom awakened from his coma out of concern.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #211 (August 2004). DC Comics.</ref>

==={{anchor|Rogue War}}Rogue War===
Zoom is freed from imprisonment by [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] (Dr. Barbara Minerva), seeking to recruit him into the growing [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. Although the two share a minor attraction and romance, Zoom still considers himself married to Ashley.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #219 (April 2005). DC Comics.</ref>

Zoom infiltrates the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogue]] war between [[Captain Cold]]'s Rogues, the [[Trickster (comics)|Trickster]]'s reformed Rogues, and the [[Top (comics)|Top]]'s brainwashed Rogues. After spiriting Ashley out of danger to Linda's home, Zoom returns to the battlefront to dispatch Captain Cold whom he believes is wasting the Flash's time.<ref name=f223>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #223 (August 2005). DC Comics.</ref> As Wally and Kid Flash ([[Bart Allen]]) attempt to contain the battle, Zoom threatens to snap Bart's neck in a manner reminiscent of what Barry had done to [[Eobard Thawne]] (Professor Zoom aka the original Reverse-Flash). Before Zoom can kill Kid Flash, however, Thawne arrives on a cosmic treadmill with [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] chained to the front end.<ref name="f223"/>

A battle ensues between the three Flashes and the two Zooms. Zolomon and Thawne capture Wally and jump onto the treadmill. Hunter then forces Wally to repeatedly experience their first fight in which Linda was severely injured, feeling that West should be made to focus on feelings of sorrow and loss to become a better hero. However, Barry arrives on his own cosmic treadmill in search of Thawne. Barry subsequently saves Wally and returns Thawne to the predecessor's proper place in the timeline. The enraged Zoom then begins running around the world, building up speed to collide with and kill Linda. Wally catches up with Zoom and pushes him, causing the villain to fall forward into the sonic boom that he himself used to kill Linda's twins, thus creating a "fissure in time" that restores Linda's pregnancy. Wally grabs Zoom and uses the treadmill to return to the present. Zoom recognises his mistreatment of Wally and briefly apologizes before slipping into the timestream. He is later seen as a ghostly figure apologizing to Ashley.

Zoom returns during the "[[Infinite Crisis]]" event as the Secret Society of Super Villains' chief speedster. He serves as a member of the Society's strike force, scarring Damage with super-speed punches and massacring the [[Freedom Fighters (comics)|Freedom Fighters]].<ref>''Infinite Crisis'' #1 (2005). DC Comics.</ref>

===One Year Later===
{{main|One Year Later}}
Zoom later appears at the sacking of Rome; it is unknown whether he travelled to this time period himself, or if he became stranded there after his last encounter with Wally. Zoom is asked by Bart's [[Iris West|grandmother]] to help protect Bart from a tragedy plotted by the villain [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]].<ref>''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #10-#12 (2007). DC Comics.</ref> He is also pursued by the [[Justice League]] who seek to locate [[Sinestro]] after [[Batman]] and [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] learn of the [[Sinestro Corps]]' existence.<ref>''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 (August 2007). DC Comics.</ref> Zoom is chased by the [[Justice Society of America]] to Atlanta. Damage, seeking revenge on Zoom, takes the villain hostage during a scuffle until being talked down by [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]]. Disappointed that Damage is not "improving", Zoom throws a sharp pipe to kill Damage. Liberty Belle uses super-speed to catch it and toss it back, knocking Zoom unconscious.<ref>''Justice Society of America'' (vol. 3) #8 (October 2007). DC Comics.</ref> Zoom later becomes a member of [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]]'s Secret Society of Super Villains.

===Final Crisis===
{{Main|Final Crisis}}
In ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'', Zoom frees Inertia from the paralysis inflicted by Wally, hoping to make an apprentice out of Inertia by teaching how to "improve" both his own life and the lives of others by inflicting tragedies.<ref name=fcrr1>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #1 (September 2008). DC Comics.</ref> Kid Zoom learns this lesson too well and ultimately betrays the Flash's [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]] and Zoom himself, revealing his own desire to make the heroes suffer whereas Zoom wanted them to work through their pain.<ref name=fcrr2>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #2 (October 2008). DC Comics.</ref> Inertia then uses his mentor's own timestream manipulation powers against him, unravelling Zoom's timeline and reverting him to the crippled, powerless Zolomon.<ref>''Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge'' #3 (November 2008). DC Comics.</ref>

===The Flash: Rebirth===
{{Main|The Flash: Rebirth}}
Hunter approaches the resurrected and imprisoned Thawne at [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]], stating that they can help each other to be better.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (April 2010). DC Comics.</ref>

===DC Rebirth===
In the [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch, when [[Iris West]] seemingly kills Eobard in the 25th Century, a cloaked figure sends the [[Rogues (comics)#The Renegades|Renegades]] back in time to arrest Iris. The hooded man is then revealed to be Zolomon proclaiming that the only way to make the Flashes better heroes is to pit them in a war where they'll experience tragedy.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) Annual #1 (March 2018). DC Comics.</ref> Zolomon muses that he sees Wally as the 'true' Flash, reflecting that Barry's ability to accept death is the crucial difference between Barry and Wally as the Flash (feeling that Wally goes into situations determined to survive) and musing that this difference is how he'll provoke his planned war.

It is later revealed that Thawne brought Zolomon into the twenty-fifth century as part of Zolomon's prior suggestion that they could help each other be better, the two manipulating the Renegades and agreeing on the need for the Flashes to take a different approach, but they soon parted ways because Thawne felt that, in the end, Zolomon still had faith that the Flashes could be what he imagined them to be whereas Thawne had given up on that idea. After Thawne's 'death', Zolomon finally concedes to Thawne's ideas, returning to his appearance as Zoom and proclaiming that he will provoke the Flashes to war if they will not cooperate with his vision themselves.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #46. DC Comics.</ref> He subsequently draws Wally to him, claiming that he has lost his powers and regained his sanity, and provokes Wally's memories of lost children, convincing Wally that the Speed Force must be sacrificed to release the other speedsters- including the Flash's children, Impulse and Max Mercury- who are trapped within it, provoking Barry and Wally to war against each other due to their conflicting views on Hunter's 'advice'.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #47. DC Comics.</ref> The situation escalates when Barry and Wally's conflict breaks the Speed Force, allowing Hunter to draw on the energies of other forces- including what he terms the Strength Force and the Sage Force, enhancing his physical strength and knowledge-<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #49. DC Comics.</ref> but when he tries to use these powers to set history to his own design, he is pursued by the Flashes and lost when he breaks the Speed Force, leaving his location unknown and rendering time travel impossible for the Flashes and any other heroes or villains.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #50. DC Comics.</ref>

===Death to the Speed Force===
After he massacred all the Flashes in the multiverse and terrorized Gorilla City, he began searching for the Still Force user. After stealing the Still Force, Hunter reveals to Barry that the combined forces create an entirely new one called the Forever Force, allowing him to see all of time and space. Barry gives chase, along with the [[Black Flash]] hot on their trail, intent on purging the other Forces from the Speed Force. Hunter proclaims his goal is to kill the Black Flash, as he says it's his destiny to kill "death itself" after all the tragedies in his life. Barry then shows Hunter a memory fragment in the Forever Force, explaining he investigated Hunter's case on Ashley's father, discovering that Thawne played a part in the murder by giving the Clown a gun before the final confrontation. Distraught by this revelation, Hunter starts to slow his pace. Hunter is reminded that he broke the Force barrier by using Barry and Wally, so they also must find a way to repair the barrier in order to return and solve the mystery of Thawne's involvement. Hunter feels remorse for all the tragedy he inflicted on Wally, his best friend, and against Barry's pleas, resigns to fix the barrier by sacrificing himself as the '''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]''' for atonement, due to him currently wielding the power of all four Forces. He expresses a wish that things could have been different, but then remarks that saving the day is what Flashes do. After telling Barry to tell Wally that he wishes the two could have remained friends, his plan works and the Black Flash is also banished to the Forever Force.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #81. DC Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
While most speedsters in the [[DC Universe]] draw their powers from the [[Speed Force]], Hunter Zolomon has the ability to alter time relative to himself, manipulating the speed at which time flows around him. With every step he takes, he uses time travel to control his personal timeline; he slows it down to move faster and speeds it up to move slower, effectively allowing Hunter to run at "superhuman speeds". He can also create powerful sonic booms and electrical shockwaves by snapping his fingers, and is able to grant a form of "super-speed" to other beings by giving them the ability to control their relative timelines through himself; a connection that Zoom can shut down at will.<ref name="fcrr1"/><ref name="fcrr2"/> Due to his slowed perception of time, Zolomon's strength and physical attributes have been heightened to superhuman levels, allowing him to effortlessly react to danger and be able to withstand punches from speedsters while sustaining no serious injuries.<ref name="f197"/><ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #199 (August 2003)</ref><ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #200 (September 2003). DC Comics.</ref><ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #214 (May 2005). DC Comics.</ref> The temporal nature of Zoom's powers renders him unaffected by the usual problems and hindrances encountered by other speedsters, such as friction and perception when moving at heightened velocities.

Hunter possesses a keen mind, as he was once an [[detective|investigator]] specialising in the study of [[criminology]] and [[psychology]]. Zolomon is also an expert in many forms of hand-to-hand combat, including the [[martial arts]] form [[Taekwondo]], and an avid cross country runner and jogger even prior to gaining [[metahuman]] powers.<ref name="f197"/>

* First appearing in [[The Flash (season 2)|season two]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', Zolomon ends up on [[Earth-1 (Arrowverse)|Earth-1]] and passes himself off as "Jay Garrick" to the Flash of Earth-1, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]], and ostensibly became his ally while secretly sending numerous Earth-2 [[metahuman]]s to challenge Allen and push him to become faster. To avoid suspicion, Zolomon uses a time-remnant copy of himself to ensure that Zoom and "Jay" are always seen in two different places at the same time. However, his budding romance with [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin Snow]] forces him to reveal his non-metahuman Earth-1 [[doppelgänger]] (also portrayed by Sears), which leads to Team Flash deducing his identity. After curing himself of his affliction and killing Allen's father [[Henry Allen (Arrowverse)|Henry Allen]], Zoom attempts to destroy the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] except for Earth-1, but Barry thwarts his plans, allowing Time Wraiths to transform Zoom into the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]-esque '''[[Black Flash]]''' before dragging him out of reality for corrupting the Speed Force. In [[The Flash (season 3)|season three]], the Black Flash hunts down [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]], but [[Killer Frost (Arrowverse)|Killer Frost]] freezes and shatters the former. Zoom also makes a cameo appearance in the [[The Flash (season 5)|season five]] episode "[[What's Past Is Prologue (The Flash)|What's Past is Prologue]]".
