'''{{'}}Mazing Man''' is the title character of a [[comic book]] series created by [[Bob Rozakis]] and [[Stephen DeStefano]] and published by [[DC Comics]].<ref>* [http://bobrozakis.blogspot.com/2013/12/bobro-archives-lost-mazing-man-script.html BobRo Archives: Centurions - A Thirty-Year-Old Interview] Transcript of an interview with WCEYE. Blog post by Bob Rozakis, March 4, 2016</ref> The series ran for twelve issues in 1986, with additional special issues in 1987, 1988, and 1990. Additionally, a 'Mazing Man origin story was featured in ''[[Secret Origins]]'' #16, and an original one-page story that appeared as an ad in ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/mazingmn.htm |title='Mazing Man}}</ref>

== Series overview ==
The ''{{'}}Mazing Man'' series depicts the misadventures of '''Sigfried Horatio Hunch III''', a benignly deranged little man in [[Queens, New York|Queens]], [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] who dresses in a homemade costume and performs deeds like unclogging drains and watching out for local children. Viewed as a harmless kook by his neighbors, he saves a child from being hit by a truck in the first issue, earning him some respect and notoriety, not to mention a steady stream of appreciation (and food) from the mother in subsequent issues.

"'Maze" tends to sing [[Simon and Garfunkel]] songs when struck on the head. His best friend is Denton Fixx, a writer for BC Comics who looks like a dog. Hunch is a millionaire, having won first place in a magazine subscription company's [[sweepstakes]]. After winning the prize, he felt obligated to subscribe to all of the company's magazines. As a result, he receives a staggering load of publications daily, including the pornographic magazines that he genuinely reads only for the articles. He does not keep his wealth a secret ''per se''; he simply does not mention it and does not live an opulent lifestyle. His friends are unaware of his financial success.

==Reception==
The original series, although highly acclaimed, was short-lived. Comics artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] admired the series. Eager to help the property survive, Miller contributed a cover with the lead characters of the extremely popular [[mini-series]] ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' for the last issue. The resulting exposure created enough interest for three subsequent [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] issues.

A back-up feature, "Zoot Sputnik", drawn by [[Fred Hembeck]] and (ostensibly) written by Denton Fixx, appeared for several issues; it was supposed to be the book Fixx wrote for BC Comics. "Zoot Sputnik" was a parody of the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] narrative style where stories had no between-issue continuity â€” Zoot and his team were space adventurers in one issue and cowboys in the next. The team's dog received a shock of energy and gained the ability to remember their disparate adventures. This was Denton's attempt to introduce continuity to the book, but it was met with disapproval by his editor.

''{{'}}Mazing Man'' is one of a handful of DC titles to publish an issue not featuring the [[Comics Code Authority]] stamp of approval while it was active. In the issue "Writer's Block", Denton is stuck for a story, and all his friends give their ideas. One of them dealt with an army of [[zombie]]s. Although there was no gore or violence, any mention of the living dead, specifically the use of the word "zombie", was forbidden by the Comics Code. The issue was released without the seal, with no publicity, positive or negative.

Much later, in the ''[[Ambush Bug: Year None]]'' miniseries, 'Mazing Man (in the same nonsensical way of the series) is revealed to be on death row.
