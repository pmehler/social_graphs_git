==Publication history==
===Cain===
[[File:Swamp Thing and Len Wein.jpg|thumb|right|Cain's appearance was based on that of then-young comics writer [[Len Wein]] (right), shown with his creation, [[Swamp Thing]].]]
Originally, Cain was the "host" of the [[EC Comics|EC]]-style [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[Comic book|comic]] [[Anthology|anthologies]] ''The [[House of Mystery]]'' which ran from the 1950s through the early 1980s. Cain, "the Able Care-Taker", created by [[Bob Haney]], [[Jack Sparling]] and [[Joe Orlando]], first appeared in ''The House of Mystery'' #175 (July – August 1968),<ref name=Guide>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=58}}</ref> modeled on writer [[Len Wein]], who was new to the field.<ref name="Millennium Edition 2000">[[Mark Waid]].

''The House of Mystery'' was cancelled in 1983. The final issue showed Cain in front of the House for sale, with his bags packed, and Gregory, his pet gargoyle, behind him. The cover of [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]]'s mostly-[[reprint]] ''Welcome Back to the House of Mystery'' showed him returning with Abel and Gregory. ''The House of Secrets'' and ''[[The Witching Hour (DC Comics)|The Witching Hour]]'' were eventually merged with ''[[The Unexpected (1968 comic book)|The Unexpected]]'' and cancelled around the same time. Cain then became a supporting character in ''[[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]'', with Abel and Gregory making occasional appearances as well.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-08-14|title=The House of Mystery: The Strangest Home in the DC Universe|url=https://comicyears.com/comics/history-of-the-house-of-mystery/|access-date=2020-11-18|website=Comic Years|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Abel===
Originally Abel was the respective "host" of the [[EC Comics|EC]]-style [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[Comic book|comic]] [[anthology]] ''The [[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'', which ran from the 1950s through the early 1980s. Abel, created by Mark Hanerfeld, [[Bill Draut]], and Joe Orlando, first appeared in ''[[DC Special]]'' #4 (July – September 1969) and began hosting ''The House of Secrets'' with #81 (August – September 1969).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=242}}</ref> Hanerfeld was the model for Abel, and he also appeared in a photograph in ''Elvira's House of Mystery'' #4.<ref>[[Twitter|Tweet]] from Len Wein, March 6, 2012</ref><ref name=Guide/><ref name="Millennium Edition 2000"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Wells |first1=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1965-1969 |date=2014 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490557 |page=215}}</ref><ref name="cbr.com"/>

===Together===
During the 1970s, they also co-hosted (along with Abel and [[Eve (DC Comics)|Eve]]) the horror/humor anthology ''[[Plop!]]'' Both comics had been running ''[[Dial H for Hero]]'' and ''[[Eclipso]]'', respectively, before the introduction of the new host characters. ''The House of Secrets'' and ''[[The Witching Hour (DC Comics)|The Witching Hour]]'' were eventually merged with ''[[The Unexpected (1968 comic book)|The Unexpected]]'' and cancelled around the same time.

The cover of [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]]'s mostly-[[reprint]] ''Welcome Back to the House of Mystery'' showed Abel returning with Cain and Gregory. Both of the anthologies that Cain and Abel debuted in are cited as one of the comic books that [[Neil Gaiman]] grew up with which helped pave the way for Cain and Abel revival within ''[[The Sandman (comic book)|The Sandman]]'' comic books.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Grickowski |first1=Fish |title=Neil Gaiman's The Sandman world thriving in Vertigo comics, and now Netflix |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/books/neil-gaimans-the-sandman-world-thriving-in-vertigo-comics-and-now-netflix |website=edmontonjournal |access-date=25 November 2020 |language=en-CA}}</ref><ref name="DC's Sandman explained">{{cite web |last1=Clough |first1=Rob |title=DC's Sandman explained |url=https://www.looper.com/234039/dcs-sandman-explained/ |website=Looper.com |access-date=18 November 2020 |date=6 August 2020}}</ref>

On the letters page of ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #3 (November 1972), [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]] stated that Cain, along with Abel and Eve, were ''not'' the same characters as their Biblical counterparts, whom Destiny said he found much more pleasant. Cain, Eve and, to a lesser extent, Abel, subsequently taunt Destiny for being dull. ''[[The Dreaming (comics)|The Dreaming]]'''s early issues (#1-4, #8) established that Cain and Abel are their biblical counterparts. It was annotated that they did not know whether they were or if they had false memories but found evidence tying them to their biblical counterparts during the course of the story. In the 8th issue, their wives, [[Awan (religious figure)|Jumella]] (Abel's twin and Cain's wife) and [[Aclima]] (Cain's twin and Abel's wife), who are also their twin sisters, and [[Seth]] were introduced to the DC Universe.

[[File:Homforsale.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cain and Gregory move out in the final issue of ''The House of Mystery'', issue #321 (October 1983), art by [[Michael Kaluta]].]]
Cain told tales of various people who boarded at the House of Mystery. Abel stammeringly took abuse from both Cain and the House of Secrets itself, and had an "imaginary" (it was always rendered in quotes) girlfriend named Goldie, who berated him too.<ref name="dc-ency 1"/> In the early issues, Abel told the stories directly to Goldie, although he always appeared to be alone. He said she was a ghost.

Cain is a thin, long-limbed man with an angular, drawn face, glasses, a tufty beard, and hair drawn into two points above his ears. Cain is often mean to Abel, but he is jovial and a friendly storyteller to children and did everything he could to help [[Superman]] when the need once arose; however, he has no qualms trapping innocent people inside his television set<ref>''The House of Mystery'' #213</ref> and he was once employed by a vicious mink furrier.<ref name="The House of Mystery #254">''The House of Mystery'' #254</ref> Abel is a nervous, stammering, kind-hearted man. Abel also has a tufty beard and hair that comes to points above his ears, though his hair is black rather than brown. He is shorter and fatter than Cain, with a more open face. It is eventually stated (in ''The Sandman'' vol. 2 #40) that the only time he doesn't stutter is when he is telling a story, and this was characteristic of his earlier appearances. Cain owns a large green draconian [[gargoyle]] named Gregory, who first appeared (as a baby) in ''The House of Mystery'' #175, apparently the offspring of enchanted sculptures who come to the house for a French sculptor who murdered the artist who designed them. Gregory grew to maturity over the course of the series and continued to appear in ''Sandman'' stories. Gregory ate the [[Earth-1]] counterparts of writer [[Paul Kupperberg]] and editor [[Jack C. Harris]].<ref name="The House of Mystery #254"/> Cain also used to have a black cat named Oskar, who did not get along with Gregory.

Abel moved in with Cain in the House of Mystery shortly before ''[[DC Special]]'' #4, which Cain states is a temporary situation until the House of Secrets is transported (which occurred in ''The House of Secrets'' #81, which appeared one month later). Their ages are vague, but Abel presents a story that he claims to have heard from Cain, who scared him with it as a child in 1957.<ref>''DC Special'' #4, pp 44 and 48</ref>  The story in question originally appeared in ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (comics)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' #17 (September 1957).

In the final issue of ''The House of Mystery'', [[Karen Berger]], whom Cain first met in issue #292—the first issue she edited for DC—arrives as an unexpected guest at Cain's birthday party, takes him through a secret door that leads to the DC offices, and tells him that his series has been canceled and that he is too old-fashioned. The House is torn down, and Cain [[metafiction]]ally analyzes his own existence as a character in a comic book.<ref>''The House of Mystery'' #321</ref>

In 1985, the characters were revived by writer [[Alan Moore]], who introduced them into his ''[[Swamp Thing]]'' series in the issue #33, retelling the Swamp Thing's original origin story as depicted in a 1971 issue of ''House of Secrets''. Cain kills Abel for revealing a secret (the difference between a mystery and a secret is that a mystery can be shared and still remains a mystery) and declares to [[Abby Holland]], "I invented murder!" In ''[[Blue Devil (DC Comics)|Blue Devil]]'' #20 (January 1986), Cain is the caretaker of "The House of Weirdness" until Blue Devil moves in, and discovers that Abel is there, too. He states that the California mansion is owned by "a publishing company back East".

During the ''Crisis'', although not mentioned in that series, [[Cassandra Peterson|Elvira]] stumbled onto the House of Mystery, which charged her to find Cain, who had disappeared. [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] can be seen through a window in the garage of the House of Weirdness.<ref>''Blue Devil'' #21</ref> Cain and Blue Devil can be seen peering at Elvira in ''Elvira's House of Mystery''.<ref>''Elvira's House of Mystery'' #1</ref> Cain and Abel reappeared in ''Swamp Thing'' #49-50, where they acted as observers and commentators on a fierce battle in Hell.

They were depicted together in Abel's first appearance, and they parted to their respective Houses at the end of the story, the House of Secrets having been recently moved, with Cain promising things not to go the way they happened before. Although Cain would abuse Abel, he was not shown killing him until ''Swamp Thing'' vol. 2 #33. More often than not, though, they did not appear together, and Cain directed more of his taunts at the reader, while Abel tried to reassure Goldie or the reader.  Indeed, in ''The House of Mystery'' #257 (April 1978), an asylum escapee, "Killer" Cowan, kills six people on [[Christmas Eve]], storming into the House of Mystery wearing a [[Santa Claus]] suit and demands Cain to keep him occupied by entertaining him with stories. Cain protests that he does not want to entertain someone who ruins all that the holiday stands for. Abel is said to be a voyeur in ''[[Secrets of Sinister House]]'' #14, and shown to be such in ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|The Sandman]]'' vol. 2 #60.

===''The Sandman'' and ''The Dreaming'' ===

The second volume of ''The Sandman'', written by [[Neil Gaiman]], reintroduced the characters. It is implied by dialogue between Lucifer and Cain (who had been sent by Dream as a messenger due to his invulnerability) that the biblical [[Cain]] and [[Abel]] came to live in [[The Dreaming series|the Dreaming]] at [[Dream (DC Comics)|Dream]]'s invitation. To support this, Lucifer quotes the verse in the [[Bible]] which says that Cain was sent to live in the [[Land of Nod]]. This could be a post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] [[retcon]]'', however, as [[Destiny (DC Comics)|Destiny]] claimed in ''[[Weird Mystery Tales]]'' #3 that they were not the same as the Biblical Cain and Abel. The nature of reality in the Dreaming is often multiple and when Cain, Abel, and Eve are telling young Daniel Hall three stories, Cain objects to Abel's "Lil' Endless" style retelling of their origin claiming that "... they (the [[Endless (comics)|Endless]]) didn't even look remotely human, none of us did!" Abel later responds to Matthew the Raven's query about whether they are their biblical namesakes or not by stating; "...oh, none of this happened on Earth..." before being interrupted by Cain. Eve also states that she is not Cain's mother to which Cain replies, "You're everyone's mother".<ref>''The Sandman'' vol. 2 #40</ref> This sequence of events would seem to indicate that rather than being the actual literal beings Cain, Abel, and Eve the Dreaming's incarnation of them are closer to their archetypal roles of first murderer, first victim, and first mother. This is supported by several incidents when Cain or Abel have identified themselves as such and claimed that their cycle of murder and resurrection is punishment for their role in the first murder.<ref>''Swamp Thing'' vol. 2 #33</ref> This would also allow [[Joe Kubert]]'s DC Comics adaptation of the Cain and Abel story from the Bible, in which he ignored their "Mystery" likenesses, to fit neatly into canon.<ref>Limited Collectors' Edition C-36 ''(The Most Spectacular Stories Ever Told... From The Bible)'' (June – July 1975)</ref>

Cain frequently kills Abel in a kind of macabre form of obsessive-compulsive disorder, re-enacting the first murder.<ref name="dc-ency 1"/> In the Dreaming, Abel's death is impermanent, and he seems to recover after a few hours. Cain seems unable to control his frequent murders of Abel, and occasionally expresses remorse over them; there is a genuine bond between the two, beneath the surface contempt. Abel remains dedicated to Cain, and frequently dreams of a more harmonious relationship between the two.

In turn, in the graphic novel ''[[The Sandman: The Wake]]'', Cain is so distraught when Abel is murdered permanently by the Kindly Ones, he sinks into a rambling mess when asking the new Dream to restore him. In preparation for the funeral services for the deceased Dream, Cain's anger boils over yet again when Abel reveals a secret, but he is calmed by a reprimand and restrained from murdering Abel. He displays a contract, renewed in 1989 (the year ''The Sandman'' began) that states that only he is allowed to kill Abel, because Abel can resurrect only when Cain kills him.

In the first appearance of the characters in ''The Sandman'' vol. 2 #2, Cain gives Abel an egg that soon hatches into another gargoyle, a small golden one. Abel is delighted and names the gargoyle "Irving", but Cain forcefully insists that the names of gargoyles must always begin with a "G". When Abel resists, Cain murders him, and after Abel revives he renames the gargoyle "[[Goldie (DC Comics)|Goldie]]", after a friend of his who "went away".

The main function of Cain and Abel throughout ''The Sandman'' is as comic relief. However, the two play significant (though not key) roles at several points in the series; it is they who take Morpheus in until his strength is restored following his 72-year-long imprisonment. In the fourth [[story arc]], ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]'', Cain is sent to Hell to give a message to [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]] because the [[Mark of Cain]] protects him. Those who would harm Cain would have the full wrath of God visited upon them. Lucifer merely finds this funny, since he is already in Hell.

Cain and Abel also aid [[Corinthian (comics)|The Corinthian]] with the child [[Daniel Hall (comics)|Daniel]] during ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'', the penultimate story arc of the series. They also appear with Morpheus in ''[[The Books of Magic]]'' #3.

===Recent history===
Recently, both Cain and Abel have appeared in the new ''[[House of Mystery (Vertigo)|House of Mystery]]'' title. Abel appeared in the missing House of Mystery with Goldie, claiming to be on a secret mission to retrieve the various nightmares that were still in the house when it vanished. Meanwhile, Cain, under the guise of a mysterious coachman, plotted with various groups to retake the House of Mystery, which he saw as his rightful property. Eventually, Cain was able to broker a deal to become the co-manager of the House of Mystery's current incarnation as a bar, and both he and Abel have become regular members of the series' cast.

==Other characters ==
===Gregory===
Gregory is a large green gargoyle and the pet of Cain. He communicates in "grunts", which the inhabitants of the Dreaming appear to understand. He helps Goldie re-assemble Abel when Cain kills him. He first appeared as the child of two stone gargoyles in ''The House of Mystery'' #175, wherein his parents perched on the House of Mystery until they were able to kill their sculptor, a boarder in the house who had murdered their designer, and left without their egg. He later appears during the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' crossover event, defending [[Scandal Savage]], the new owner of the House of Mystery, from the members of the [[Suicide Squad]].

In ''Weird Mystery Tales'' #3 (November – December 1972), Destiny insisted that Eve, Cain, and Abel are not their Biblical eponyms. When she is shown in ''The Sandman'' vol. 2 #2, Lucien's comment about her addresses her unfriendly nature prior to Dream's return, stating that she confines herself to nightmares.

In her early appearances, she appears only as a [[crone]], is often identified as a witch, and has a tendency to sharp speech. In her first appearance, she scares Cain and Abel and shouts at them, "Get out of the kitchen when it gets too hot, you cowardly mortals! Old Eve doesn't care..." Her letter column, which was answered in character, was called "Witch's Tales". She appeared as a principal character in stories in ''Secrets of Sinister House'' #9 and 11 and ''Weird Mystery Tales'' #18. In issue #9, she stays in an apartment building under an assumed name (she denies it is her in the letters column of issue #13), where the smell of her cooking causes her neighbor to report her to the superintendent, so she curses the neighbor to repeat a day — which begins wonderfully and ends in two deaths — over and over again.

Eve lives in a cave in the Dreaming and is often accompanied by Dream's raven. The first raven, Lucien, taught her how to bury Abel after Cain murdered him and she has been accompanied by a raven ever since. She is kind and has a maternal nature, though she retains her sharp language. Most of the time she appears as a black-haired woman of indeterminate age, but sometimes appears as a young, attractive maiden, a middle-aged mother, or an elderly crone. When she is first seen in ''The Sandman'' #2, she looks little different from her original appearances.

==Reception and analysis==
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Cain slaying Abel (Courtauld Institute).jpg|thumb|right|The original Biblical tale of [[Cain and Abel]] within the [[Book of Genesis]] depicting [[Cain]] slaying [[Abel]], a recurring pattern with the DC Comics publication is the depiction of Cain murdering Abel over and over again, similar to the old Biblical narrative as shown above. Classic artwork is ''Cain Slaying Abel'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]
Both Cain and Abel are listed as part of the top 10 of characters by [[Comic Book Resources]] that are wanted to see from the Sandman comics that is [[The Sandman (TV series)|planned to be adapted]] by [[Netflix]].<ref name="Sandman"/> Bibek Bhattacharya of ''[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]]'' felt that the backstories of DC's major Biblically adapted characters (Cain, Abel and Eve) from ''The Sandman'' were well-told and opined that they were even more interesting than the original Biblical tales told in the [[Book of Genesis]] itself.<ref name="Sandman 2">{{cite web |last1=Bhattacharya |first1=Bibek |title=Sunday Lounge: Neil Gaiman on writing 'The Sandman' and the new Netflix series |url=https://lifestyle.livemint.com/news/big-story/sunday-lounge-neil-gaiman-on-writing-the-sandman-and-the-new-netflix-series-111605942124615.html |website=Mintlounge |access-date=25 November 2020 |language=en |date=22 November 2020}}</ref>

Within the comics, Abel is depicted as a more meek man who is commonly a victim to Cain’s murders in various gruesome ways, much like a recurring [[dark comedy]] trope.<ref name="dc-ency 1"/><ref name="IGN"/> The theme was adapted from the original tale in Genesis 4.  Abel is slain by Cain within the narrative by jealousy of the Hebrew God where he accepted [[Abel]]'s offering, but not [[Cain]]'s. In the Biblical narrative, Cain was the first murderer and Abel was the first murder victim, so it is the same within DC Comics stories.<ref name="Theme"/><ref name="DS"/><ref name="EW"/> The relationship of [[Hilda Spellman]] and [[Zelda Spellman]] within ''[[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|Chilling Adventures of Sabrina]]'' has been compared to the dynamic of Gaiman's portrayal of both Cain and Abel by editors such as Christian Holub of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and David Opie of ''[[Digital Spy]]''.<ref name="EW">{{cite web |last1=Holub |first1=Christian |title=Did you catch this 'Sandman' homage in 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'? |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/10/30/chilling-adventures-of-sabrina-sandman-homage/?amp=true |website=EW.com |access-date=18 November 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="DS">{{cite web |last1=Opie |first1=David |title=10 chilling details you might've missed in Sabrina |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a869812/chilling-adventures-of-sabrina-easter-eggs-comic-riverdale/ |website=Digital Spy |access-date=25 November 2020 |date=2 November 2018}}</ref>
