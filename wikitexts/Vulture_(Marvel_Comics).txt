The '''Vulture''' ('''Adrian Toomes''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Toomes is an [[Invention|inventive]], but maniacal genius who designed a special suit that allows him to fly at vast speeds. After turning to a life of crime, he became a recurring [[List of Spider-Man enemies|enemy]] of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]], and a founding member of the [[Sinister Six]]. Other characters have also taken the mantle.

Since his conception, the character has been adapted from into various other forms of ''Spider-Man'' media, including television series and video games. In live-action, the character was played by [[Michael Keaton]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and the [[Sony's Spider-Man Universe]] film ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'' (2022).

==Publication history==
The original Vulture, '''Adrian Toomes''', first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #2 (May 1963), and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name="Vulture 2">{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/2010/2/11/11279/archrivals_spider-man_vs_the_vulture | title=ARCHRIVALS: SPIDER-MAN VS THE VULTURE| publisher=[[Marvel Comics|Marvel.com]] | access-date=2 January 2014 | author=Beard, Jim}}</ref><ref name="What Culture 7">{{cite web | url=http://whatculture.com/film/10-spider-man-villains-and-combinations-deserving-of-the-big-screen.php/5 | title=10 Spider-Man Villains (And Combinations) Deserving Of The Big Screen (7.

==Fictional character biography==
Adrian Toomes was born in [[Staten Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He is a former [[Electronic engineering|electronic engineer]] who was once Gregory Bestman's business partner; Bestman handled the finances whilst Toomes handled the inventions. One day, after creating a flight harness, Toomes eagerly rushed into Bestman's office to share the happy news, but he was not there. Toomes discovered that Bestman had secretly been embezzling funds and then, Toomes got no legal recourse, meaning he lost his job. Enraged, Toomes wrecked the business, discovering that exposure to the harness had also granted him superhuman strength. He then decided to turn to crime professionally as the Vulture.<ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |pages=365–366}}</ref>

The Vulture employs a special electromagnetic harness of his own design that allows him to [[Flight|fly]]; his flight is directed by a pair of artificial wings worn on his arms. The harness also endows him with enhanced strength and (according to some sources) increases his lifespan. Although Toomes is advanced in age, he is a strong fighter and a remorseless killer. On one occasion, he restored his youth through biochemical means,<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #388">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #388. Marvel Comics.</ref> though this wore off after exposure to an [[elemental]] [[superhuman]]'s corpse.<ref name="The Sensational Spider-Man #18">''The Sensational Spider-Man'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> At one point, he had used a device to steal Spider-Man's youth, leaving Vulture young and Spider-Man elderly, but this effect wore off within hours.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #387. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vulture was on a robbery and burglary spree throughout [[New York City]] when he first encountered [[Spider-Man]]. Spider-Man realized for the first time he could sell photos to [[J. Jonah Jameson]] after the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' offered a reward for a picture of Vulture.<ref>{{cite book|author = Manning, Matthew K.|editor= Gilbert, Laura|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year = 2012|page = 18|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= [Stan] Lee and [Steve] Ditko focused on Peter Parker's career when they had Spider-Man develop a knack for photography in the first of [''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2's] two stories. As the sinister Vulture - soon to be a major foe of Spidey – debuted, Peter Parker set out to earn the reward money offered by ''The Daily Bugle'' for snapping a photo of the winged villain.}}</ref> Due to a preoccupation with the camera, Spider-Man was knocked out by Vulture and sealed in a water tank with sides too slippery to climb up, but was able to break free. Vulture then challenged the police, saying he was going to steal diamonds; however, he escaped through the sewers. Spider-Man had created a device that stopped Vulture's harness from working and activated it during an airborne fight with Vulture, causing the two to crash onto a roof, knocking Vulture unconscious. He was then arrested.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vulture modified his harness, and attempted to rob the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' payroll.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> He joined [[Doctor Octopus]]'s first [[Sinister Six]], and gave the message to the ''Daily Bugle'' that the group had captured [[Betty Brant]]. He was the last foe to battle Spider-Man before Doctor Octopus. He forced Spider-Man to remove the web-shooters by threatening to fly away, then squirted oil onto the roof, and tried to push Spider-Man off using a wind created by his wings, but Spider-Man escaped this. Vulture was caught after Spider-Man swung onto him using a [[lasso]]. He then told Spider-Man where to find Doctor Octopus's lair and (like the rest of the team) was jailed at the end of the story.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, believing himself to be dying in prison due to injuries obtained in the [[prison]] [[workshop]], Toomes revealed an extra Vulture outfit's location on the prison grounds to his cellmate Blackie Drago. Drago revealed to Toomes he caused the accident for this very purpose. Toomes was angry, but apparently fell unconscious within the next few minutes; Blackie then knocked out a guard, dug up the wings, and escaped.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #48">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #48. Marvel Comics.</ref> Drago, as Vulture, teamed with [[Kraven the Hunter]] against Spider-Man.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #49">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #49. Marvel Comics.</ref> Toomes ultimately escaped from prison and recovered from his injuries – crediting his hatred for Drago's betrayal with the strength to overcome them – and as the Vulture again, defeating Drago.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #63">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #63. Marvel Comics.</ref> Toomes then nearly defeated Spider-Man in battle, injuring the arm before Spider-Man managed to play possum and tricked Toomes into coming in close enough for Spider-Man to damage his power pack and force his nemesis to retreat.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #64. Marvel Comics.</ref> Some time later, Dr. Clifton Shallot mutated his body into a form resembling Toomes's, but possessing natural wings and flight capability.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #127-128">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #127-128. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Vulture later humiliated the racketeering mobster Mr. Morgan, who hired the [[Hitman (Marvel Comics)|Hitman]] to kill Spider-Man, trying to rob the Vulture of revenge.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man#Volume 1 (1976-98)Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #4–5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vulture then arranged New York's top mobsters' murders in order to be New York's new crime lord, and battled Spider-Man again.<ref name="Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #44-45">''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #44–45. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vulture later escaped prison, and battled Spider-Man again.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #224">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #224. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vulture came out of retirement to claim vengeance on his former research partner Bestman who embezzled him out of the profits of their business.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #240–241. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then confronted the [[#Vulturions|Vulturions]], a group of criminal youths who stole his designs.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #1–2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

He became involved in Atlantic City casino racketeering to prepare for his own ostentatious funeral, but was thwarted by the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]].<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Reduced to a "mere salesman", he journeyed to Las Vegas, where he attacked Morris "Snake" Diamond in the middle of the desert for stealing Toomes's blueprint journals for ultrasonic-sensitive dice. Intending to inject Snake with a mummification serum, Vulture was thwarted by Spider-Man (who had been granted a flight on Snake's plane back to New York) and Agent Sara Glenville of the Central Intelligence Division.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later confronted the mutants [[Rusty Collins]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]] in an attempt to release [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]].<ref>''New Mutants'' #86. Marvel Comics.</ref>

On more than one occasion, Toomes has been in league with several of Spider-Man's other villains in order to destroy the wall-crawler. Vulture has been in every incarnation of Sinister Six, and also appeared in the ranks of the Sinister Twelve. He has a strong friendship with fellow villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]; the two once nearly beat Spider-Man to death.<ref>''Marvel Knights Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During one of his many periods of ill health, Toomes struck up a friendship with Nathan Lubensky, a man who had become the new love of [[Aunt May|May Parker]]'s life. Nathan was unaware of Toomes's true identity, and encouraged the injured criminal to take chances with life and not to let handicaps drag him down (Nathan was a paraplegic). Toomes followed Nathan's advice and went on a crime spree as the Vulture while hiding out in his civilian identity at the same nursing home Nathan lived in, reasoning that the authorities would never think to look for him there. After Peter Parker visited the nursing home and recognized him, however, a battle ensued between the Vulture and Spider-Man. During the course of the fight, Toomes instinctively grabbed a hostage and threatened to kill him if Spider-Man did not back down; however, as soon as Toomes realized that the hostage was Nathan, he decided he could not take the life of a man who had helped to save his own. He shoved Nathan's wheelchair at Spider-Man, distracting the web-slinger long enough for Toomes to make his getaway.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #224"/>

Vulture would seemingly cherish Nathan's influence, but irony would serve him a cruel blow when he was hired by the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]] to assassinate a high-ranking casino runner. During another conflict with Spider-Man just prior to joining Doctor Octopus's new Sinister Six, the Vulture sought to use a hostage as a shield, and selected May Parker from the crowd. Nathan, who was with May, leapt from his wheelchair and grabbed Toomes. Not realizing who it was, Toomes flew high into the air with Nathan on his back. The shock of seeing how high they were caused Nathan to suffer a fatal heart attack. Toomes fled as Nathan was falling. Though he was successfully caught by Spider-Man, Nathan would die in May's arms.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #336–339. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Toomes was later diagnosed with cancer, caused by frequent exposure to the essential chemicals needed to power his flying apparatus. In an attempt to be forgiven for all of his previous sins, Vulture terrorized the Parker household, pleading that May Parker forgive him for indirectly causing Nathan's death. The enraged Parker attacked Toomes, forcing the Vulture to capture him and take him back to his old lair. After escaping Toomes, Peter switched to Spider-Man and brutally assaulted the Vulture, and in the ensuing battle, Vulture's own power pack malfunctioned and exploded, setting his wings ablaze. Spider-Man successfully ripped the burning pack off of Toomes, and the two crash landed in a muddy ditch.<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #187. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After being arrested, Toomes was returned to the Parker home so May, reunited with Peter, could identify him. May hoped that Toomes' death would be slow and full of suffering. The next day, she visited Toomes in prison and apologized to him for her cruel remarks, but also stated that she could not forgive him, and that any kind of redemption would be left up to him and [[God]].<ref>''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' #188. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vulture stumbled across a plot by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] and the [[Harry Osborn|Green Goblin]] (Harry Osborn) to drive Spider-Man insane by having [[shapeshifting]] [[Android (robot)|android]]s impersonate his late mother and father; due to Toomes' interference, the androids were destroyed, leading the wall-crawler to a brief nervous breakdown. The Vulture absorbed the artificial life force from the Mary Parker android, and the effect on the Vulture was twofold; not only did he become a young man again, but he was instantly cured of his cancer.<ref name="The Amazing Spider-Man #388"/> During this period, he attempted to kill everyone who had ever known him as an old man in an attempt to get a clean slate for his life, but this plan went wrong when he targeted a Prowler impersonator as the Prowler having once thwarted his attempted takeover of his old company; Toomes was unconcerned about the fact that the current Prowler was a thief who had stolen the costume of the original [[Prowler (Marvel Comics)|Prowler]] (Hobie Brown) and Spider-Man; although Toomes nearly gutted the fake Prowler, Spider-Man managed to get him to the hospital. During a later fight with Spider-Man, the Vulture was 'attacked' by David Kalen, a man capable of dissolving anything he touched who had turned his power on himself in his grief at the death of his brother. Toomes subsequently reverted to his old age, presumably due to Kalen's power having negated the youth effect.<ref name="The Sensational Spider-Man #18"/> His cancer, however, did not return.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}

In the ''[[Identity Disc]]'' series, it was revealed that Toomes, with the help of [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], manipulated Marvel villains [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], [[Deadpool]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] into laying siege to terrorist group [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] headquarters in order to retrieve a disc containing the identities of undercover [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] operatives, including his daughter with wife Cheryl, [[Valeria Toomes]] a.k.a. "Valerie Jessup".{{Issue|date=June 2009}}

During a brief time working for the [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]], he failed in a mission (and had his face brutally slashed by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]) and was severely beaten as punishment. He subsequently revealed himself as a member of [[Norman Osborn]]'s [[Sinister Twelve]] — though he wore a helmet, presumably to mask the wounds.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9–12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Under the tutelage of [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]], Toomes briefly attempted a stint at heroism, but before long he returned to the other side of the law.<ref>''Spider-Man: Get Kraven'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Aside from his daughter, Toomes also has a son whom he has dismissed, and a grandson from that son. The Vulture has come to care deeply for both his grandson and his mother, committing a series of robberies to finance a cure for his grandson's terminal illness. He once had a nephew, Malachai Toomes, and flew into a killing rage when he was murdered by a gang-lord.<ref name="Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man #44-45"/>

During the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'', he was apprehended along with the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]] and the [[Trapster]], by [[Captain America]] and the growing Resistance, who chained him together with Grim Reaper to a pole and broke his nose. When he was found and taken into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D., he complained, "that lunatic broke my damn nose." After Spider-Man unmasked himself, Toomes was seen in his jail cell, knitting his fingers together. As someone on the television set said they hoped it would not be any trouble for Spider-Man, Toomes said, "Oh, I think it will be."<ref>''Civil War'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Spider-Man goes rogue, Toomes is seen in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison cell speaking with Agent [[Jamie Madrox]], and commenting on Spider-Man's inherent weakness, that being his unwillingness to use his powers for personal gain. S.H.I.E.L.D. then returns his flying harness and encourages him to hunt down Spider-Man, saying that he "is now an outlaw, same as you."<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, the Vulture attacks Spider-Man at a book signing, and manages to slash him with a powerful sedative. Toomes, however, falls unconscious and, sensing something is wrong, Spider-Man rushes him to the hospital.<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Toomes wakes up a few hours later, where a doctor reveals that he has suffered a [[stroke]], and many of his muscles on the left side of his body have been paralyzed. When the doctor leaves, Spider-Man sneaks in and Toomes asks him to kill him because he is weak. When Spider-Man refuses to do so, he says that Spider-Man is also weak, and always has been. After making remarks about Uncle Ben, Spider-Man takes a pillow and begins suffocating him. He fights back, and Spider-Man removes the pillow, commenting that "For somebody who's begging to die, you fight for life pretty hard."<ref>''Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

When Alyosha Kravinoff began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal-themed superhumans, Vulture was one of his captives.<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> To stop Vulture from using his intellect to find a way to remove his bomb collar, Kraven broke his hands repeatedly,<ref>''[[Punisher War Journal]]'' vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> but with the help of Rhino, Vulture escapes.<ref>''Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Spider-Man later visits Vulture's cell to ask him about the latest person who calls himself the Vulture. Toomes says calmly that he has no connection to him, though he heard that the new Vulture was made that way by the mob and is out for revenge. He just as blandly states that while he normally hates people who steal the Vulture name, he would have no problem with him killing Spider-Man.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #594">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #594. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the "[[Spider-Island]]"' storyline, Vulture returns as the leader of an unnamed gang of penthouse thieves and murderers who have vulture-like wings, but with a new gothic style. The members of his gang have the same name of an angel that matches with the black angel look they have.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #674. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, it is swiftly revealed that the gang's technology is actually controlled by the Vulture who designed their wings so that he could shut them down with a simple signal if they tried to act against him. Having used his new magnetically sensitive webbing to catch the gang and deactivate their wings, Spider-Man defeats Toomes despite his new use of his gravity-manipulating technology to give himself seemingly superhuman strength.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #675. Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Carlie Cooper]] later works with the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Otto Octavius's mind in Spider-Man's body) to investigate a series of crimes committed by the Vulture's gang. Superior Spider-Man confronts Vulture and attempts to bribe him into giving up crime by offering him a small fortune from Octavius's hidden bank accounts. Vulture does not believe a word of it, and has his midget henchmen attack. Superior Spider-Man accidentally knocks out one of the midget henchmen who turns out to be a young boy. Realizing that Vulture has been using children all this time and remembering his own abusive childhood, Superior Spider-Man attacks Vulture in a rage. After a brief midair struggle, Superior Spider-Man blinds Vulture with a searchlight, causing him to crash onto the roof. Carlie arrives and finds Vulture, broken and bloody, but still alive.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vulture's child henchmen are then recruited by the Goblin King to be part of the Goblin Nation.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vulture is later seen in the Raft's infirmary, along with [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] and [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]]. When [[Alistair Smythe|Alistair Alphonso Smythe]] escapes with the mini-Spider-Slayers' help, the mini-Spider-Slayers are sent into the infirmary to heal and enhance Vulture, Boomerang, and Scorpion in exchange for their assistance in killing Superior Spider-Man.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> While Superior Spider-Man fights Boomerang, Vulture is sent to attack the civilians in the Raft.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Glory Grant]], [[Norah Winters]], and Smythe's lawyer plead with him to stop, claiming they can clear him of any charges, causing him to stop and consider his options. When Smythe dies, the Vulture's enhancements fail, leaving him blind once again. He is then tasered by Ted Shipley, the Raft's Chief of Security.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vulture eventually has another encounter with Superior Spider-Man, seeking revenge for his recent defeats, but is defeated again.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vulture, Chameleon, Electro, Sandman, and [[Mysterio#Mysterion|Mysterion]] are later seen as part of a team led by Superior Spider-Man called the "Superior Six", which is forced via mind control to perform heroic (and occasionally dangerous) deeds as an act of "redemption". When they are not being controlled, they are kept in containment cells.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> They eventually break free of Superior Spider-Man's control and attempt to exact revenge on the wall-crawler, nearly destroying New York in the process.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Superior Spider-Man barely manages to stop them with Sun Girl's help.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Adrian Toomes later developed a modified version of his electromagnetic harness that has a reinforced helmet and lightweight, razor-sharp, nano-woven wings which responded to his mental commands, where he took on the '''[[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]''' name, which he believed to be vacant at the time. He robbed a location in East Village where he fought Spider-Man, until they were immobilized by a new [[Trapster]] who made off with Falcon's loot.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day Vol. 2017: Secret Empire''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Spider-Man was seen thwarting Vulture's robbery when he is called in by [[Iron Man]] to help him, Luke Cage, and Jessica Jones find Wolverine's body when it goes missing from his unmarked grave.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: The Adamantium Agenda'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In a prelude to the "Hunted" storyline, Vulture is among the animal-themed characters captured by [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]] and [[Eric O'Grady#Black Ant|Black Ant]] on Kraven the Hunter's behalf. He is among those who [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]] publicly reveals as the [[Savage Six]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Vulture's son Frankie Toomes is married to a woman named Lenora. When Frankie left Lenora, Toomes often visited Lenora and her daughter Tiana to support them. At one point, Vulture took Tiana on a ride in his Vulture suit. After Lenora died from a surgical error, Adrian started to take care of Tiana. As Tiana came to age, Adrian made a suit similar to his so that Tiana can follow whatever destiny awaits. This led to Tiana being Starling.<ref>''Miles Morales: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At the time when Vulture visited Tiana, he gave her a set of pencils. When Spider-Man is sighted outside, Tiana slips off to become Starling to make sure that Spider-Man stayed away from her grandfather. During the fight, Spider-Man mentioned to Starling that her grandfather has killed people like Nathan Lubensky and Gibbon. When Spider-Man collapses upon being hit by the elephant tranquilizers she used on him, Starling realizes that she might be lying to herself about Vulture.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 5 #49. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
By utilizing his Vulture harness, Adrian Toomes is able to fly as if with a natural [[Wing|winged]] flight. He wears a costume of synthetic stretch fabric housing an electromagnetic harness with [[Artificiality|artificial]] bird-like wings attached beneath the arms. This consists of an anti-graviton generator worn on his body as a harness, enabling him to hover silently with precise maneuverability. The Vulture harness increases his resistance to injury in which that he can survive blows from Spider-Man's super strength. Another by-product of his exposure to its unique [[radiation]] as that, despite old age and no [[exercise]], Toomes' physical strength represents the upper limits in human development. When he removes it, most of these abilities would slowly fade, although the rate at which this transpires remains unclear (some writers have suggested that his strength is permanent). Toomes is also elderly and depends on the tailored suit for strength, speed, and health boosting, as well as draining life-forces to maintain his own youth. It has recently been revealed that, due to the prolonged use of his harness, he could levitate or float even without it, but Vulture still need those wings for mobility while airborne. He once upgraded a new version of his flying apparatus, complete with battle armor, metallic wings, and sharpened [[Feather|feathers]]. During the later years, he added various weapons to his arsenal. Vulture possesses brilliant expertise in the fields of electronics and [[chemistry]], with a great talent for invention.<ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z'' Vol 1 #13 (April 2010)</ref>

==Other characters named Vulture==
===Blackie Drago===
[[File:Blackie_Drago.jpg|thumb|left|Blackie Drago as Vulture.]]
'''Raniero''' "'''Blackie'''" '''Drago''' was a prison cellmate of Adrian Toomes's. He tricked Toomes by causing an accident in the prison workshop that made Toomes think he could die soon, and stole the Vulture harness and costume which was recently rebuilt. He used the suit to make money through air piracy which led to a confrontation with Spider-Man, that Drago believed ended in the wall-crawler's death (Spider-Man had merely collapsed due to a serious cold in reality).<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #48"/> After robbing a helicopter, Drago was pursued by Kraven the Hunter, who resented his claims of victory over Spider-Man, and ended up fighting him until Spider-Man arrived.

Drago was later 'rescued' from prison by Toomes - who revealed that the revelation of Drago's role in his accident had given him the strength to overcome his injuries - but that was merely so that Toomes could prove himself to be the true Vulture once again. Once the two were free, he was subsequently defeated and humiliated by Toomes, who regained the recognition he deserved. A humbled Drago was taken away by the police, vowing "I'm through!! I'll never put these wings on again! The Vulture's too much...for anyone!"<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #63"/>

Drago was later seen in the same prison that Norman Osborn was incarcerated in during the "Sinister Twelve" storyline.<ref>''Marvel Knight: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Clifton Shallot===
[[File:Vulture3marvel.jpg|thumb|right|Clifton Shallot as Vulture.]]
Doctor '''Clifton Shallot''' was an expert on bio-mutation and a professor at Empire State University.<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 30–33 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> He also had one of Toomes' harnesses and costumes, which he had requisitioned from the State Prison Authority. When one of his courses was cancelled by the university trustees, he snapped, and underwent the final stage of the mutation himself when he donned the Vulture costume – his face, teeth, and fingernails mutated, and for a short time, the wings became part of his body and he could fly. The only ones who knew his secret was his lab assistant Dr. Christine Murrow and her roommate Gloria Jenkins.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #128">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #128</ref>

[[Mary Jane Watson]] witnessed him killing Gloria (whom he had mistaken for Christine) and she became a target. While flying around Mary Jane's apartment, he noticed Spider-Man and attacked him. Vulture managed to defeat Spider-Man and leave him for dead. Shallot then searched for a way to reverse the transformation. He stole some chemicals from a ship called the ''Düsseldorf'' at Dock 20. The next morning as he was flying to Christine's lab, Vulture noticed Mary Jane in her car. He dove toward the car and grabbed Mary Jane. He was then encountered in the air by Spider-Man, who dropped Mary Jane, giving Vulture enough time to reach the Biology Lab. He attacked Christine, only for Spider-Man to arrive and defend her. Vulture managed to rip the webbing with his sharp finger claws and teeth. Their fight continued, with Spider-Man blinding Vulture with the webbing as the cops arrived and threw a net over them. Still blinded by the webbing, Vulture broke free from the net and grabbed Spider-Man, thinking he was Christine. When he saw it was Spider-Man, Vulture ended up dropping him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=71}}</ref>

Vulture went back to his lab and transformed back into Shallot. He then had an agreement with Christine, stating that he would not kill her if she did not betray his trust. Later that night, Vulture flew back to Dock 20 and stole more chemicals. He noticed that Peter Parker had followed him and picked him up and dropped him into the water. When he flew above Mary Jane's apartment, Vulture noticed her getting into a taxi. Vulture attacked the taxi and kidnapped Mary Jane, only for Spider-Man to interrupt him, causing Vulture to flee. He made it back to his lab where Christine was. Spider-Man then arrived an hour later, finding Christine there. Vulture then attacked Spider-Man, who subdued him and force-fed Vulture the antidote he had stolen from the ''Düsseldorf''. After reverting from his Vulture form, Shallot fainted. Shallot is presumably still serving his sentence for the murder of Gloria.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #127-128"/>

===Vulturions===
[[File:Vulturions.jpeg|thumb|left|Vulturions.]]
While in prison for dealing [[heroin]], an engineer named '''Honcho''' is the cellmate of Adrian Toomes, who showed his Vulture harness designs to him. Memorizing on how to construct it, Honcho (when released on parole) builds four Vulture costumes (red, yellow, and silver) complete with anti-graviton generators in which he equips himself and three petty criminals ('''Gripes''', '''Pidgeon''', and '''Sugar Face'''). Gaining all the Vulture's powers, the group members called themselves the Vulturions.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Louise Simonson|Penciller = Greg LaRocque|Inker = Jim Mooney|Story = Till Death Do Us Part!|Title = Web of Spider-Man|Volume = 1|Issue = #1|date = April 1985|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Manning |first2=Matthew K. |title=Spider-Man Chronicle: Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging |date=2012 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-0756692360 |page=147}}</ref> Becoming as big-time criminals, the Vulturions make several tries to kill Spider-Man and accumulate wealth, ultimately failing in all their attempts. Learning of the Vulturions' existence or exploits, Toomes built himself a new Vulture suit and broke out of prison, intent on hunting down his "rip-offs". By locating the group, Adrian beats and nearly murders all of them, only to be stopped by Spider-Man. After defeating the Vulture, he turned him and the Vulturions in to the police.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Louise Simonson|Penciller = Greg LaRocque|Inker = Jim Mooney|Story = Iron Bars Do Not A Prison Make...Or Vulture Is As Vulture Does!|Title = Web of Spider-Man|Volume = 1|Issue = #3|date = June 1985|Publisher = Marvel Comics}}</ref>

A new group of Vulturions (consisting of three members, including a female) appear in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', where they steal a briefcase containing classified research on gamma radiation from [[Baron Von Blitzschlag]].

Jonah Jameson. In truth, it is actually Dr. Charles Goss, a biochemist who used these machines that were previously owned by the [[Farley Stillwell|Stillwell]] brothers so they can have a new Vulture. Dr. Goss fibs that Jameson had a hand in his creation, until he confessed to the proper authorities.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #623</ref> When Spider-Man fended him off, Vulture visits the mobster again, who came clean for being behind his mutation. After that, he killed him. Vulture was later seen soaring above the ''Daily Bugle'' ruins and flew past by a jobless Peter Parker at night.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #624. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
While wearing the Vulture costume, Drago has super strength, durability, and speed, as well as flight. He added a built-in radio helmet with limited receiver functions as extra protection for his head.

As a physical duplicate of the Vulture, Shallot has enhanced strength, resilience, and mobility, along with natural fangs and talons. He is capable of flight, due to the wings grafted onto his body. 

Each of the Vulturions wore costumes similar to Toomes' electromagnetic wing harness that granted them heightened physical attributes and flight. They can use blow darts to totally paralyze their opponents or a corrosive for melting glass in seconds.

The Red Vulture possesses inhuman strength and durability, as well as flight, natural talons, and acid expulsion. His costume is identical to Toomes, complete with bladed feathers.

In response, he persuades his colleagues [[Tinkerer (Marvel Comics)|Phineas Mason]], [[Shocker (comics)|Herman Schultz]], [[Montana (comics)|Jackson Brice]], and [[Darter (comics)|Randy Vale]] not to relinquish the salvaged [[Chitauri (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Chitauri]] technology they collected, and they go on to start a scavenging operation and black market weapons ring. After deducing [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Spider-Man]]'s secret identity when the web-slinger interferes with his operation in the present, Toomes threatens retaliation unless Spider-Man stops, sparing his life since the latter previously saved Liz's life. However, Spider-Man thwarts Toomes' attempt to hijack a plane carrying much of the [[Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Avengers]]' weaponry and saves Toomes' life when his suit malfunctions before [[Happy Hogan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Happy Hogan]] and the FBI find and arrest Toomes. As a result, Toomes' family moves away. In a mid-credits scene, an imprisoned Toomes is approached by [[Mac Gargan (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Mac Gargan]], who wants to confirm whether the former knows Spider-Man's identity, which Toomes denies.
