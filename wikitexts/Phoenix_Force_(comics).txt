The '''Phoenix Force''' is a fictional entity appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The Phoenix Force is famous for its central role in ''[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]'' storyline, and is frequently linked to [[Jean Grey]].

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}
The Phoenix first appeared in ''The [[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #101 (October 1976) in the guise of Jean Grey, and was created by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Dave Cockrum]].

==Fictional character biography==
The Phoenix Force is an immortal and immutable manifestation of the universal force of life and passion. The Phoenix Force is a creation of the universe that was born of the void between states of being. It is the nexus of all [[Psionics|psionic]] energy of the past, present, and future in all realities of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]], the Guardian of Creation and of the dangerously powerful [[M'Kraan Crystal]].

The Phoenix Force is among the most feared beings in all of existence—it can cut, re-grow, or destroy any part of the universe. It has been described as being "the embodiment of the very passion of Creation—the spark that gave life to the Universe, the flame that will ultimately consume it."{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

During its time as a sentient and formless mass of energy, it traveled the cosmos and was worshiped by several alien races, including the [[Shi'ar]], who named the entity Phal'kon, the "sister" of their other gods [[K'ythri]] and [[Sharra]].<ref name="The Mighty Thor vol. 2 #18">''The Mighty Thor'' vol. 2 #18</ref>

According to the alien peace-keeping robot Unit, a billion years ago the alien Demon Lords of Stasis cast a spell on their planet to stop the Evolution. However, five powerful beings led by a female with pyrokinetic powers wage a rebellion against the Lords of Stasis. The rebellion drew the Phoenix to the planet. Although the Demon Lords fight to prevent it, the Phoenix communes with the female and with the loyalty of her disciples that helps her to control the infinite power of the Phoenix, she breaks the spell and the Demons are swept away.<ref name="The Uncanny X-Men vol. 2 #13">''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 2 #13</ref>

The Phoenix is later drawn to Earth when Firehair, a young primitive female red-haired mutant overwhelmed with despair by her friends' deaths, contemplates turning her psychic abilities on herself to commit suicide at the "Burnt Place". Attracted to Firehair's untapped raw psychic power, the Phoenix prevents the suicide, bonds with her, and seeks to use her to fulfill its intended purpose of razing planets to ashes. Consumed by vengeful rage, Firehair nearly gives in to the firebird's bloodlust to become a Dark Phoenix, but is pacified by her wolf guardian and decides to use her powers to protect those weaker than herself. Using the alias Lady Phoenix, she joins that time period's incarnation of the Avengers. Her only known fight is with an out-of-control [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]] called the Fallen.<ref name="Marvel Legacy #1">''Marvel Legacy'' #1</ref> During this time she and [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] share a romantic relationship that Odin considers the one time in his life when he truly felt alive.<ref>''Generations: The Unworthy Thor & The Mighty Thor'' #1</ref> It was later claimed that from their love, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] was born,<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 8 #42-44</ref> but in truth, Phoenix left Odin due to his callousness, until millennia later, she arranged for Odin and Gaea to conceived a child. When Thor was born, his birth was felt by King Laufey who immediately killed him. The Phoenix resurrected him, leaving him permanently imbued with some of her power.<ref>''Avengers: 1,000,000 B.C.'' #1</ref>

===The Rise of Dark Phoenix===
At some point, the entity ends up in Shi'ar space, where it bonds with a citizen of the Empire named [[Rook'shir]], who controls the power of the Phoenix Force in conjunction with his blade. He is ultimately overwhelmed by the Phoenix's power and becomes the first known host to succumb to the Phoenix Force's destructive impulses, going insane from the power it embodied and becoming the Dark Phoenix. Rook'shir goes on a destructive rampage through the Empire and destroys many planets in the process. He is killed by the [[Imperial Guard (Marvel Comics)|Imperial Guard]], which later becomes the first line of defense of the Shi'ar Empire. The Phoenix flees, leaving a small remnant of itself in the blade, which can only be lifted by Rook'shir's descendants. Fearing the power of the Phoenix, the Shi'ar demonizes the entity and orders the deaths or sterilizations of Rook'shir's descendants.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #479">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #479</ref>

As time passes, the entity is contacted by a mage named [[Feron]]. Feron worships the legendary [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]], so his daydream-like visions prompts the Phoenix to adopt the fiery bird's form. He asks the Phoenix to help him by lending its energy to project a lighthouse-like stone pillar across the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]]. The pillar later becomes the lighthouse base for the British superhero team [[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]. Afterwards, [[Necrom]] attacks Feron to steal the power of the Phoenix. Strengthened by the Phoenix Force, Feron is able to fight back, but Necrom steals a fraction of the Phoenix Force's essence, forcing it to flee back to space in agonized confusion.<ref name="Excalibur #50">''Excalibur'' #50</ref>

In the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century, [[Yu-Ti]] of [[K'un-L'un]] has visions of the Phoenix coming to Earth and of a red-headed Iron Fist who would confront it. In one vision, she loses control and destroys the world; in another, she tames its power. When walking the streets, Yu-Ti comes across Fongji Wu, the daughter of a woman who had ventured to the outside world and lain with a man from beyond K'un-Lun.<ref name="The New Avengers vol. 2 #25">''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #25</ref> After defeating [[Shou-Lao]] and becoming the Iron Fist, Fongji confronts the Phoenix Force and becomes its host.<ref name="The New Avengers vol. 2 #25"/> The Phoenix Force attempts to overwhelm Fongji and turn her into a Dark Phoenix, but she resists the being's control. Determining that she needed to leave Earth in order to prevent the possibility of losing control, Fongji ventures off into space, never to be seen again.<ref>''The New Avengers'' vol. 2 #27</ref>

===Jean Grey===
Centuries later, the Phoenix Force returns to Earth without a host when it feels the mind of a human transcend the physical realm and resonate with its energy. A young [[Jean Grey]] telepathically linked her mind to her dying friend, Annie Richardson, to keep Annie's soul from moving to the afterlife. In doing so, Jean's mind is dragged along to the "other side" with Annie. Phoenix lends its energy to break the connection, and keeps a close watch on her because it felt a kinship with the young [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]]. Years later, when Jean is dying on a space shuttle, her mind calls out for help and the Phoenix Force answers and saves her, transforming Jean into the [[Phoenix (comics)|Phoenix]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #101</ref>

The Phoenix remains with the X-Men for only a short time. She prevents the complete destruction of the universe by repairing the damaged energy matrix at the core of the M'Kraan Crystal.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #108</ref> During a skirmish with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], Phoenix and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] are separated from the other X-Men, each group believing the other to have perished.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #113</ref> In Greece, Phoenix meets a man named Nikos, later revealed to be [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]], a mutant that can [[Illusion|alter the perceptions of others]]. He plants seeds of dissent within Phoenix's fragile psyche by comparing her to a god and insisting she could do whatever she wished.<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #24</ref> She encounters him again in [[Scotland]] under the guise of Jason Wyngarde, believing him to be both the work of the reality-warping mutant [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] and the lover of one of her ancestors.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #122</ref>

After an encounter with the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]] and manipulation by Mastermind and the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], the Phoenix is transformed into their [[Black Queen (comics)|Black Queen]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #132</ref> She breaks free of Mastermind's control, but transforms into Dark Phoenix. She battles the X-Men, flees to the stars, devours the energies of the [[D'Bari]] star system to satisfy her "hunger" as Dark Phoenix, annihilates the five billion inhabitants of its fourth planet, and destroys a nearby Shi'ar observatory vessel that opens fire on her before she returns to Earth. There, Dark Phoenix is defeated in psionic combat by [[Professor X]], and Jean Grey regains control. The X-Men, along with Phoenix, are teleported to space by the [[Shi'ar]] and given a trial by combat. Just as victory seemed certain for the Imperial Guard, Jean becomes Dark Phoenix again. She apparently commits [[suicide]] on Earth's moon before [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #134-137</ref>

As originally written, the Jean Grey incarnation of the Phoenix is Jean herself, having attained her ultimate potential as a psi, becoming a being of pure energy and reforming herself as Phoenix,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #125</ref> only to become slowly corrupted by the manipulation of such foes as Mastermind and Emma Frost; unable to adapt to her enormous power, Jean is driven mad.

In order to return Jean to the fold several years later, this storyline was [[retcon]]ned to reveal the existence of the cosmic Phoenix Force entity, which had created a duplicate body of Jean, believed itself to be Jean and acted in her place while the real Jean lay in a healing cocoon at the bottom of [[Jamaica Bay]], where the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Fantastic Four]] discover her.<ref>''The Avengers'' #263; ''Fantastic Four'' #286; ''Classic X-Men'' #8</ref> It allowed Jean to be revived as a member of [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]]. The extent to which the duplicate and Jean are separate entities depends on who is writing the characters at the time: some instances portray them as inherently separate, while others demonstrate a shared consciousness.

After committing suicide, the Phoenix Force reaches the Hot White Room where it encounters a manifestation of [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and returns itself to Jean in the cocoon. Horrified by what it has done, Jean rejects it and it fuses with Jean's clone, [[Madelyne Pryor]].<ref>''Classic X-Men'' #43; ''X-Factor'' #38</ref> This portion of the Phoenix remains with Madelyne until she commits suicide while fighting Jean Grey before rejoining Jean's consciousness.<ref>''X-Factor'' #38</ref>

===Rachel Summers===
Another known possessor of the Phoenix Force is [[Rachel Summers]], Scott Summers and Jean Grey's daughter from the ''[[Days of Future Past]]'' alternate future.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #141</ref> The Phoenix Force bonds with Rachel, making her the next avatar of the Phoenix Force.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #199</ref> Rachel is one of the longest reigning avatars of the Phoenix, and while she eventually adopts the uniform, she never becomes Dark Phoenix.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #10</ref> Rachel has been referred by the entity as "The One True Phoenix".<ref>''Excalibur'' #64</ref>

During an encounter with [[Galactus]], Rachel Summers—completely overtaken by the Phoenix Force—battles Galactus to save a planet he was preparing to devour.<ref>''Excalibur'' #25</ref> The Phoenix Force disrupts Galactus' feeding process and easily defeats him. Galactus accuses the Phoenix Force of hypocrisy and reveals to it that its existence in a corporeal state is sustained by robbing energy used to birth future generations. Realizing this to be true, the Phoenix vows to return to its prior existence of "touching all that is" while allowing an echo of its power to remain with Rachel's now-dominant consciousness.<ref>''Excalibur'' 61 (Late Jan. 1993)</ref><ref>''Excalibur'' #63 (March 1993)</ref>

===Into the Future===
Returning to Earth with all her memories, Rachel manages to return to the future she had come from. While she could not change her past, she and her teammates are able to change the directives of all the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] of the era to preserve all life, ending the genocide that had prevailed for years.<ref>''Excalibur'' #67 (July 1993)</ref> On the way back to her time, [[Captain Britain]] is lost in the timestream and Rachel is forced to switch places with him, as she does not belong in the timeline she had existed in.<ref>''Excalibur'' #75</ref> She emerges from the timestream about 1,900 years in the future and forms the Clan Askani, which is responsible for bringing her brother Nathan to their time to fight [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]]. She later encounters Diamanda Nero, Apocalypse's High Councilor and viceroy. She tries overpowering him, but is left powerless after being shortly bonded to the Phoenix Force.<ref name="X-Men: Phoenix #1-3">''X-Men: Phoenix'' #1-3</ref>

===Phoenix resurrection===
As an interdimensional portal transports four villains from the 616 [[Marvel Universe]] into the [[Ultraverse]] dimension, the Phoenix Force is also pulled into the Ultraverse and critically damaged. Requiring a human host to recover, the Phoenix Force bonds with [[Prime (comics)|Prime]] then with [[List of Marvel Comics characters: H#Amber Hunt|Amber Hunt]].<ref>''The Phoenix Resurrection: Genesis'' #1</ref> Amber, unable to control the Phoenix Force's power, attacks her friends and would have destroyed the planet if the [[X-Men]] and new Ultra hero [[Foxfire (Ultraverse)|Foxfire]] had not arrived, who after a long battle are able to separate the Phoenix from Amber and send the cosmic entity back to the [[Earth-616|616]] universe.<ref>''The Phoenix Resurrection: Revelations'' #1</ref>

Jean Grey begins to wear the same costume the Phoenix Force had worn, manifest Phoenix firebirds, and tap into its cosmic reserves several times, worrying Scott as he feared the Phoenix had returned<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #356</ref> until Jean temporarily loses her powers as a result of the Psi-War.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #358</ref>

In order to help Psylocke after the Psi-War, Jean switches powers with her. Jean loses her telekinesis but her telepathy increases greatly. Jean begins to manifest "Phoenix raptors" that represent her telepathic powers "honed to their sharpest edge". As a result of the power switch, Jean temporarily displays a shadow astral form with a Phoenix symbol over her right eye.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #381</ref>

Jean begins manifesting the Phoenix raptor, creating a rift between her own and Scott's relationship, and the entity starts to appear as another personality within Jean, having a conversation with Professor Xavier on its role in events to come. When the X-Man Xorn reveals himself to be a traitor who claimed to be Magneto, he traps Jean and Wolverine on Asteroid M, which is drifting closer to the Sun. Rather than watch Jean die a slow painful death, Wolverine tries to kill Jean, but he awakens the Phoenix Force within her. Using her incredible powers, Phoenix/Jean returns with Logan to New York City to face "Magneto". Xorn's last act is to kill Jean with an electromagnetic pulse.<ref>''New X-Men'' #150</ref>

===''Endsong'' and ''Warsong''===
The Phoenix Force returns to Earth during the mini-series ''[[X-Men: Phoenix – Endsong]]'', where it resurrects Jean Grey from her grave. It is not long before she remembers what she has come for—Scott Summers. She needs to feed from the energy from his optic blasts, and, confused by her own emotions, thinks she is in love with Scott. She realizes Scott is in love with [[Emma Frost]], former White Queen of the Hellfire Club and headmistress of the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning]]. Through a number of incidents, Jean manages to assert herself and gain control of the Phoenix Force with emotional support from the X-Men. Jean then declares that she and the Phoenix Force are truly one entity, have transcended into the White Phoenix of the Crown, signified by a new white and gold costume.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix Endsong'' #1-5</ref>

As a result of a Shi'ar attack on the Phoenix Force, the entity is in an incomplete state and Jean must search out the remaining parts of the Phoenix Force. The consequences of this were partially addressed in ''[[X-Men: Phoenix – Warsong]]'' in which a small part of the Phoenix Force joins with the [[Stepford Cuckoos]]. After nearly losing control to the Phoenix power, the Stepford Cuckoos develop a secondary mutation, where their hearts turned to diamond and they are able to imprison the piece of the Phoenix Force.<ref>''X-Men: Phoenix Warsong'' #1-5</ref>

===End of Greys===
With the failed attack on the Phoenix Force that ended with Jean Grey escaping their suicide bomb attack and returned to the White Hot Room to restore herself, the Shi'ar still want to permanently prevent the ascension of the Phoenix Force. In hopes of eliminating the possibility of a new Omega-level psionic mutant becoming a host for the Phoenix Force, the Shi'ar sent a commando unit—the Death Commandos—with the purpose of wiping out the Grey genome and killing [[Quentin Quire]] to Earth. They arrived at Rachel's family reunion site and kill all the members of the Grey family, except Rachel, who was marked, and Cable, who was not present. Afterward, at the graves of the Grey family, Rachel vows revenge on the Shi'ar and says: "I'm not my mom. I'm not the Phoenix. I'm my own woman. And by the time I'm done... they'll wish I WERE the Phoenix."<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #466-471</ref>

===''Kingbreaker''===
In the last issue of ''[[Kingbreaker]]'', the Phoenix abandons Rachel and Korvus during battle with [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]]'s new guard, leaving them both without its power. As it leaves Rachel mutters "Please, not now... Mom." implying that Jean is calling back the missing pieces of the Phoenix Force, and perhaps planning another resurrection. Rachel later says that it was almost like the Phoenix was never with her for she "[c]an't feel it... I can't hear it...It's like it was never there."<ref>''Kingbreaker'' #4</ref>

===The Sisterhood===
Around the same time in [[San Francisco]], the [[Madelyne Pryor|Red Queen]] and her Sisterhood attack the X-Men; first trapping Emma in a psychic barricade by [[Lady Mastermind]]. Inside what appears to be the White Hot Room, a woman resembling Jean Grey appears to Emma and helps her break free of Regan's influence with what appears to be a miniature version of the Phoenix energy raptor to let her help Logan, who has been robbed of a lock of Jean's hair that was in his possession. Madelyne uses the hair sample to locate Jean's gravesite, and then attempts to repeat a resurrection ritual with her corpse, but Cyclops had ordered [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] to substitute the body for someone else's and it causes Madelyne to either discorporate or become absorbed into the fake.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men #511''</ref>

===Utopia===
During a conflict with several [[Predator X (comics)|Predators X]] (genetically engineered mutant hunters), the Stepford Cuckoos are overwhelmed and knocked unconscious as the fragment of the Phoenix they captured forcefully escape from the girls' diamond hearts.<ref name="Uncanny X-Men #517">''The Uncanny X-Men'' #517</ref>

===''Second Coming''===
During the final confrontation with [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]], [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] turns into what appears to be the Phoenix and blasts Bastion, who manages to grasp Hope's neck. Hope touches the ground, goes full Phoenix Force, and blasts Bastion and the dome.<ref>''X-Force'' vol. 2 #28</ref>
Later at a celebratory bonfire, Emma notices the flames around Hope take the shape of the Phoenix and Emma recalls the Sisterhood attack where the woman resembling Jean freed her from Lady Mastermind's illusion.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2</ref>

===Generation Hope===
While fighting the fifth so-called "Light", who was out of control, Hope attempts to take some of his powers only to exhaust herself and collapses. She is contacted by the Phoenix Force who refers to Hope as her "child", and that the other lights needed her. Hope regains consciousness and goes back to face Kenji Uedo.<ref>''Generation Hope'' #3</ref>

===Age of X===
The Age of X reality is created when [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]]'s mind reacted to [[Doctor Nemesis]]'s attempt to restore its sanity.<ref name="Legacy244">''X-Men: Legacy'' #244</ref> In this reality, Jean Grey's Phoenix Force ability causes a tremendous amount of destruction and death in Albany.<ref name="HLog2">''Age of X: Historical Log'' #2</ref> Although she was presumed deceased when the Air Force bombs the area, a new phoenix shape emerges from the rubble.<ref name="AoX 1shot">''Age of X: Alpha''</ref> Under the name of Revenant, it is not known whether she is Jean Grey (presumably dead after the Albany incident<ref name="HLog2"/>) or a new incarnation. She joins Magneto and becomes part of the Force Warriors.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #245</ref>

When the truth about the Age of X is revealed, Legion apologizes to everyone before rewriting the universe and putting everything back the way it was. However, Revenant is also brought back to Utopia.<ref>''New Mutants''  vol. 3 #24</ref> Later, as all mutants begin to regain their true memories, Revenant is revealed to be the mind of Rachel Summers given human form.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #248</ref>

===''Fear Itself''===
During the ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, the Phoenix Force appears to Emma Frost. The Phoenix mocks her, saying that Scott Summers would never love her as he loved Jean Grey. It seems to be a side effect of when Emma invaded Juggernaut's mind and began feeding into Emma's fears. As the Phoenix convinces Emma that Hope is Jean reincarnated, it tells Emma that she knows what to do. Emma, in a trance-like state, takes her pillow and is about to smother her to death,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #542</ref> but [[Namor]] intervenes.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #543</ref>

===''Avengers vs. X-Men''===

Art by [[John Romita Jr.]] ''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #5 (June 2012)]]
During the ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'' storyline, the event has the Phoenix Force returning to Earth, presumably to reclaim Hope Summers, which leads to a confrontation between the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the X-Men on how to deal with its arrival. The Avengers anticipate the destruction that the Phoenix could bring while Cyclops hopes to use the Phoenix Force to restart the mutant population.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #1</ref>

As the Phoenix Force nears Earth, the Avengers fight the X-Men on the Blue Area of the Moon with Hope caught in the middle, while [[Iron Man]] and [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]] prepare a disruptor weapon to kill the Phoenix Force. Iron Man pilots the weapon against the Phoenix Force, but when he uses it to blast the Phoenix Force, the entity is forcefully altered and divided into five fragments that bond with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Namor, [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and [[Magik (Illyana Rasputina)|Magik]]. They defeat the Avengers and head back to Earth with Hope.<ref name="avx5">{{cite book|title=Avengers vs. X-Men #5|year=2012|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=22}}</ref> It is theorized that [[Scarlet Witch]]'s spell of "[[Decimation (comics)|No more mutants]]" angered the Phoenix, and to calm the entity, a new host was needed along, with five acolytes, to succeed at bringing about evolution (the acolytes were actually revealed to be the first five new mutants that have appeared around the globe since the decimation of the mutant population), and that was the reason the Phoenix came to Earth.<ref name="The Uncanny X-Men vol. 2 #13"/>

When the Avengers defeat Namor in an attack on [[Wakanda]], his portion of the Phoenix Force becomes divided between the other four members of the "Phoenix Five", making it harder to defeat them.<ref name="avx8">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #8</ref> [[Spider-Man]] then baits Colossus and Magik into taking each other out by playing off of their fears when fighting them in a volcano, forcing their portions of the Phoenix to be divided between Emma and Cyclops.<ref name="avx9">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #9</ref> When Cyclops invades the mystical city of K'un Lun, [[Lei Kung (comics)|Lei Kung]] defends the city on the back of the immortal dragon Shou-Lao the Undying, and reveals it had defeated the Phoenix in a past incarnation. While Cyclops defeats the dragon, Hope is able to absorb its power and defeat Cyclops who then goes to seek the other remaining portion of the Phoenix Force possessed by Emma Frost.<ref name="avx10">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #10</ref> Emma had been using the Phoenix Force to control all of Utopia, read the thoughts of everyone on the planet, take vengeance on anyone who had ever harmed a mutant, and dismantle all Sentinels.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #32</ref> Cyclops defeats Emma and elevates to the level of Dark Phoenix, killing [[Professor X]] in the process.<ref name="avx11">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #11</ref>

In the final issue, the X-Men and the Avengers battle the Dark Phoenix, but they are losing as the Dark Phoenix starts to burn the world. As a last resort, [[Captain America]] sends in Hope and Scarlet Witch, who together manage to take down the Dark Phoenix, while Jean Grey appears within Cyclops' mind and convinces him to let go of the Phoenix Force. The Phoenix escapes Cyclops' body and enters Hope Summers'. Together, Hope and the Scarlet Witch wish away the Phoenix Force and the damage it caused, in the process activating the X-gene that allows the creation of new mutants around the world.<ref name="Avengers vs. X-Men #12">''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #12</ref>

Even with the Phoenix gone, its effects remain in various ways, with four of the former Phoenix Five—Cyclops, Emma Frost, Colossus and Magik—suffering from various problems with their powers as well as Magneto, due to his prolonged time on Utopia. Cyclops and Magneto's control over their abilities regress back to the level of control that they had possessed in their first appearances, Emma Frost retains her diamond form but only has erratic control over her telepathy,<ref>''All-New X-Men'' #3</ref> and Colossus' body fluctuates between his organic and his metal parts rather than completely transforming into one or the other.<ref>''Cable & X-Force'' #2</ref> While Magik's powers initially appeared to have been increased to the point where she can channel the power of Limbo on her own,<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #1</ref> a confrontation with Dormammu reveals that her new power is destroying Limbo each time she used it.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #5</ref> It is later revealed that the power disruptions experienced by Cyclops, Emma, Colossus, Magik and Magneto were actually the result of nano-sentinels unleashed on them by [[Dark Beast]].<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' vol. 3 #22</ref>

Simultaneously, while spending some time in deep space, Iron Man helps defend an ancient planet from space pirates. He is later confronted by robotic police officers looking to arrest him for [[deicide]]. Before he is able to escape the planet, Iron Man realizes that the planet's people, known as the Voldi, worship the Phoenix Force and his hand in its disappearance has angered them.<ref>''Iron Man'' vol. 8 #6</ref>

===''Time Runs Out'' and ''Secret Wars''===
At some point during the ''Time Runs Out'' storyline, Cyclops acquires a Phoenix Egg that he holds in reserve, hoping to use it to end the Incursions.<ref name="Avengers Vol. 5 #38">''Avengers'' vol. 5 #38</ref>

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Cyclops stands on top of the Phoenix Egg during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. Cyclops uses it to become one with the Phoenix Force again, and uses his powers to decimate the Children of Tomorrow.<ref name="Secret Wars #1">''Secret Wars'' #1</ref> After the realities collapse together, the Phoenix-Cyclops was one of the few survivors to come through the Incursion with a full memory of what had come before, proclaiming that resurrection was the goal of their mission.<ref name="Secret Wars #3">''Secret Wars'' #3</ref> He is killed by [[Doctor Doom|God Emperor Doom]] in a subsequent confrontation.<ref name="Secret Wars #4">''Secret Wars'' #4</ref>

===All New, All Different Marvel===
It has since been revealed that thousands of years ago, the civilization of planet Maveth was able to create a bomb that, when used, scorched the entire surface of the planet, killing all life within a generation; however, a second bomb is discovered by Gamora and Kitty Pryde to be hidden in the tomb of Maveth's king, which in turn is also being sought by the [[Chitauri]]. To Kitty's surprise, the bomb is actually an artifact that contained a fragment of the Phoenix Force. In order to escape from the Chitauri alive, Kitty accidentally activates the bomb, which kills the Chitauri and apparently releases the fragment of the Phoenix Force into the Universe again.<ref>''Guardians of Infinity'' #6</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Phoenix Force can manipulate cosmic energies and tap into the life-force reserved for future generations, which denies their existence. It can wield this energy to project beams of immense destructive force. It can migrate throughout time and space by folding its energy back into itself, causing it to collapse akin to a [[black hole]] and then reform itself upon reaching its destination. It can directly absorb offensive energy such as Cyclops' optic blasts or the energy and life-force from a foe. As it is the nexus of all psionic energy, it has mental abilities on a cosmic level, including [[telepathy]] and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]].

It allows its preferred host to perform cosmic pyrokinesis, as it allows Lady Phoenix from 1,000,000 BC Avengers to summon preternatural flames that can melt supernovas.<ref name="Marvel Legacy #1"/> For Jean Grey, it allows her to perform cosmic pyrokinesis strong enough to easily defeat [[Terrax]], as she is in complete control of her own cosmic fire that after Terrax submits to his defeat, the fire dissipates at her will leaving him charred. She also uses the cosmic fire blast to counter Galactus.<ref name="ReferenceB">''Generations: Phoenix & Jean Grey''</ref> In some conditions, a bit of cosmic fire can easily burn anything it comes into contact, as when it possesses young Jean Grey she unconsciously melts the equipment the medics try to put on her.<ref>''Jean Grey'' #9</ref>

The extent of the Phoenix Force's abilities has not been fully clarified. Jean Grey as The White Phoenix of the Crown is able to change the future of a universe by reaching back in time and urging Cyclops to move on with his life.<ref>''New X-Men'' #154</ref>

Another major display of the power of the Phoenix is during the Secret Wars II. Rachel Summers seeks to kill the [[Beyonder]], who expresses both amazement and disappointment in her. With that, the Beyonder gives Rachel full access to the power of the Phoenix as well as some of his own. With such power, Rachel is able to absorb the consciousness of every sentient mortal being in the universe.<ref>''The Uncanny X-Men'' #203</ref>

The Phoenix often seeks hosts with strong inherent psionic abilities so they can withstand its power. When the Phoenix Force enters a host, a small fragment of its power is left behind when it leaves. Even a small fragment can be stronger than an inexperienced host using the Phoenix Force's powers, such as with Rachel Summers, who has full access to the Force, but her opponent Necrom threw moons at her with only a fragment.{{Issue|date=July 2010}} When bonded with a host, the Phoenix Force amplifies their abilities to incalculable levels. It can manipulate matter on a sub-atomic level and transmute elements, like turning wood to gold or stone to crystal; on a smaller scale, it can alter the molecular fabrics.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> It can teleport others across space and open interdimensional [[Wormholes|portals]] to instantly access distant portions of the Universe. If an avatar of the Phoenix Force is harmed or killed, it forms an "egg" of cosmic power around them that is incubated in the White Hot Room, and hatches out completely healed. As one of the oldest cosmic beings, the Phoenix Force possesses a high level of cosmic awareness and prescience.

===Earth X===
Although the origins and history of Phoenix of the ''[[Earth-X]]'' limited series match her Earth-616 counterpart, the Phoenix Force is originally a citizen of the first universe that existed before the Big Bang that created the current universe in which Earth-9997 resides. The original universe collapsed due to the manipulations and reproduction of the Celestial race. There are a number of survivors who were referred to as "The Elders of the Universe", the Phoenix Force being one of these elders. It is later revealed that the Elders plan to reunify the fragmented universe (and all its parallel universe and alternate history counterparts) through the Realm of the Dead and with the aid of Death.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

The Phoenix Force is a part of the plot to reverse the damage the Celestials had already created. As the Elders were all nearly immortal and could not die, the Phoenix Force binds itself to Jean Grey. Unable to bind with her severely burned body, it becomes a binary being with her and assumes her identity, personality, and physical form, while sealing her charred body in a cocoon to heal. When the shuttle crashes the cocoon sinks to the bottom of Jamaica Bay, and the Phoenix Force takes Jean's place.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

The Phoenix sacrifices her life and the real Jean Grey returns. The Phoenix ended up in Death's realm in Jean's form, and is one of the few beings in this realm that are aware they are dead. She joins Mar-Vel's army to battle Death and her army. During this time, Scott Summers is able to establish a mental rapport with the Phoenix and kept informed as to the goings-on in the Realm of the Dead and Mar-Vel's Paradise.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

After the creation of Mar-Vel's Paradise, Phoenix becomes one of the Avenging Host, a group of former champions who are transmogrified by technology that belonged to the High Evolutionary. During her time as one of the Avenging Host, its members begin to doubt Mar-Vel's intentions. Their doubts in Mar-Vel's quest are strengthened when they realize that no new dead were appearing in Death's former realm. Phoenix relays this information to Scott, prompting the heroes of Earth-9997 to seek out Jude, the Entropic Man, to become the new Death. When Cap, 3-D Man, Comet Man, Benny Becksley, and Thanos learn that each "Paradise" created for the realms citizens is wish fulfillment, the Avenging Host helps free each citizen from their private "heaven" and resolve to confront Mar-Vel about his intentions.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

The host and Rick Jones are summoned and put on trial by Mar-Vel. Confronted by Mar-Vel with Captain America, Phoenix and the rest of the host are killed by the leader when Cap refuses to take Mar-Vel's power. Shortly after their death, the Kree army invades Paradise and instigates a large battle. During the combat, Reed Richards arrives from the Negative Zone and confronts Mar-Vel. During their talk, Mar-Vel resurrects the Avenging Host to help the citizens of Paradise defeat the Kree invaders. After the battle's conclusion, Phoenix's whereabouts are unknown.{{Issue|date=December 2010}}

===Ultimate Marvel===
[[File:Phoenixattacked.JPG|250px|left|thumb|The Phoenix being attacked by its creations. Art by [[Tom Raney]].]]
In the ''[[Ultimate Marvel]]'' Universe, a young [[Jean Grey#Ultimate Jean Grey/Marvel Girl|Jean Grey]] is placed in a mental institute after she hears voices and sees visions of an omnipotent '''Phoenix God'''. After her release, she thinks she contacted a celestial God-entity that destroyed worlds as well create life.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #68</ref>

As a result, the [[Hellfire Club (comics)#Ultimate Hellfire|Hellfire Club]]<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #25</ref> believes that it should summon the Phoenix and merge it with Jean via a ritual. While the ritual is successful, the Phoenix has different plans and kills the Hellfire Club. In the Hellfire and Brimstone arc, the Phoenix Force makes its first appearance as the entity within Jean's body. Jean gains some control over Phoenix at the expense of using dangerous amounts of its power and causing extreme destruction.

Charles Xavier is confronted by [[Lilandra Neramani]], the leader of a religious group known as the [[Shi'ar#Ultimate Shi'ar|Church of Shi'ar Enlightenment]], who worship a god known as the Phoenix. As a result of their meeting, Lilandra asks to study Jean Grey to determine whether she is the embodiment of the Phoenix Force. During the examination, the Phoenix entity apparently asserts itself in an evil form but is seemingly suppressed by Professor Xavier's more experienced psychic powers and his emotional outreach to Jean Grey's normal personality.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #62</ref>

After the suppression of what seems to be the Phoenix Force, Lilandra and Charles are informed by Gerald, Lilandra's assistant, that Jean tested negative. He reveals that Jean Grey's parents have a connection to the Shi'ar Church and postulates that her subconscious has manifested a false Phoenix persona after being subjected to Phoenix Force stories in her youth. Feeling that she has lost her mind, Jean slips into a depressed state and begins seeing green creatures latched on to her body. It is then revealed that Jean tested ''positive'' as the carrier of the Phoenix Force and Gerald has covered it up under orders from his actual superiors: the Hellfire Club.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #70</ref>

Jean learns to control the powers of the Phoenix. When [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] prepares to kill the time-displaced Xavier, Jean accepts the Phoenix, creating a humanoid fiery entity whose power is able to bring down the "ancient being". She alters reality completely and resets time to undo the damage done by Apocalypse and supposedly by Professor Xavier.<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #90-93</ref>

In ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]/[[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]]'' Annual #1, a teenage [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]] is shown to be host to the Phoenix, and a member of that timeline's X-Men.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===''What If?''===
The Phoenix has been the subject of ''[[What If (comics)|What If]]'' on a number of occasions.

* The timeline shown in ''What If?'' vol. 2 #32 and #33 diverged from the main timeline just before the Phoenix dies. Rather than committing suicide, the Phoenix is given a psychic lobotomy by the Shi'ar and returned to Earth with the X-Men to live as Jean Grey. Phoenix and Cyclops marry, and she gives birth to Rachel Summers. Phoenix refuses Magneto's offer to restore her powers, but eventually regains them in an encounter with Mastermind. In a fit of despair, Phoenix kills the real Jean Grey, who is lying in stasis at the bottom of the sea. When the rest of the X-Men discover that "Jean" has become the Phoenix again, she temporarily leaves before returning to save them from an attack by the Sentinels. Scott and Phoenix reconcile, but Destiny tells Phoenix that she only saw death in her future if she tried to remain among mortals. In response, the Phoenix leaves the Earth to wander the universe alone.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #32 and #33</ref>
* The timeline shown in ''What If?'' vol. 2 #79 diverges from the main reality on the day the X-Men's shuttle passes through cosmic radiation during re-entry to Earth. Jean Grey is knocked out, so [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] volunteers to steer the capsule with her elemental powers. All of the X-Men except Wolverine die during the crash. Storm seemingly survives and emerges from the wreckage as Stormphoenix, displaying absolute control over all aspects of the weather. She erects a benevolent dictatorship on Earth, drawing young mutants to her side and freezing the super-beings who oppose her in the atmosphere. As she grows crueler and detached from humanity, the remaining heroes—as well as her acolyte, Kitty, and her mentor, Ahadi—plan to get rid of her. They examine the space capsule and find the real Storm, who had been placed in a healing cocoon and submerged in the Hudson Bay. Kitty takes over her body and they confront Stormphoenix as the fake she was. Shocked back to its senses, the Phoenix leaves Earth, but the real Storm dies in the process.<ref>''What If?'' vol. 2 #79</ref>
* The ''[[What If (comics)#Volume 6|What If? X-Men: Rise and Fall of the Shi'ar Empire]]'' looks at what would have happened if [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]] had inherited the powers of Phoenix via the [[M'Kraan Crystal]]. In this reality, Vulcan ends up inside the M'Kraan Crystal instead of Professor X. Through the M'Kraan Crystal, Vulcan ascends to the White Hot Room where he meets the Phoenix Corps, one of them being Kid Omega, who says that Vulcan does not belong there. Vulcan takes Kid Omega's powers. He slays all the Phoenix Corps and takes their power. He leaves the Crystal and takes the pieces of the Phoenix Force out of Rachel and Korvus. Wielding supposedly the full Phoenix Force, he destroys the Shi'ar Empire, Xavier, Nightcrawler, [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], the [[Starjammers]], [[Gladiator (Kallark)|Gladiator]] and Lilandra. Only Rachel and Havok survive through a teleportation portal opened by Jean Grey. Vulcan destroys one third of the [[Annihilation Wave]] along with [[Annihilus]] himself. Nova pleads [[Ronan the Accuser]] to escape, but Vulcan destroys the Kree Empire. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]] comment that the Phoenix "consumed" a galaxy. Rachel and Havok arrive on Earth. They, along with Cyclops and Cable, engage Vulcan. The battle takes place on [[Krakoa]]. Vulcan begins to lose control during the battle. Rachel warns him that the Phoenix Force reacts poorly to negative emotions. The consequences of losing total control will not only consume himself but all of reality. Letting go of the rage and hate he holds, Vulcan halts his rampage and accepts his death. As Vulcan ascends to the White Hot Room, he meets Jean Grey, who is the White Phoenix of the Crown. He is comforted by Jean who jokingly tells him that she always had a soft spot for Summers men.<ref>''[[What If (comics)#Volume 6|What If? X-Men: Rise and Fall of the Shi'Ar Empire]]''</ref>

===''X-Men: No More Humans''===
In ''X-Men: No More Humans'', Raze – the future son of Wolverine and Mystique who becomes trapped in the present — attempts to force the X-Men to accept his new status quo by teleporting all humans off of Earth and summoning other mutants from worlds where they are being oppressed, with one of them being a Jean Grey who maintained her Dark Phoenix state albeit under the control of her world's Mastermind. The present Grey confronts her time-displaced counterpart and appeals to her to help the X-Men undo Raze's actions and save the displaced humans. In the process, they create a new Earth in a pocket dimension for the refugee mutants.<ref>''X-Men: No More Humans''</ref>

==Crossovers==
Phoenix has appeared in the following [[intercompany crossover]]s:

* Dark Phoenix teamed up with [[Darkseid]] in ''[[The Uncanny X-Men and The New Teen Titans]]'' crossover between [[DC Comics|DC]] and Marvel Comics' respective teams. The story was made by [[Chris Claremont]], [[Walt Simonson]] and [[Terry Austin (comics)|Terry Austin]] in 1983. The story follows Darkseid conversing with [[Metron (comics)|Metron]] for the [[Anti-Life Equation]] at the edge of the Universe. Metron and Darkseid make a deal, and Dark Phoenix becomes part of that equation. The [[Teen Titans]] try to stop Darkseid, with the help of the X-Men, who later go head to head with [[Deathstroke]] the Terminator. The Dark Phoenix breaks free from Darkseid's grasp, is briefly hosted by Cyclops, and eventually dies [[comic book death|again]].
* The Phoenix Force is transported to the [[Ultraverse]] where it possessed the [[pyrokinesis|pyrokinetic]] ultra [[Amber Hunt (comics)|Amber Hunt]]. The X-Men, [[Ultraforce (comics)|Ultraforce]], [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], and numerous other characters team-up to stop the Phoenix from destroying the world.<ref>''The Phoenix Resurrection'' #1-4</ref>

==In other media==

===Television===
[[File:X-Men ep-32.jpg|thumb|The Phoenix's power displayed via [[Jean Grey]] in the ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series|X-Men animated series]]'']]
* The entire saga of the Phoenix is retold and adapted in the third season of the [[X-Men: The Animated Series|''X-Men'' animated series]], subdivided into the five-part "Phoenix Saga", in which Jean Grey acquires the power of the Phoenix and the battle for the M'Kraan Crystal occurs; and the "Dark Phoenix Saga", showcasing the battle with the Hellfire Club, the Phoenix Force's transformation into Dark Phoenix, and the battle to decide her fate. As the Phoenix Force retcon occurred before the creation of the series, the episodes were made with this change in mind—rather than have Jean develop her powers independently or be replaced by the cosmic Phoenix Force entity, the two concepts were merged: Jean's body is possessed by the Phoenix Force, leading to a struggle between two independent entities. Jean pilots a shuttle, and when her telekinetic shield fails Phoenix enters her body. Rather than destroying an inhabited system—which was the cause for the decision to kill off the character in the comics—the animated story had her destroy a deserted system and only disable the attacking Shi'ar cruiser. These changes made it possible for aspects of the original ending of ''Uncanny X-Men'' #137, in which Jean survives, to be used. Jean commits suicide (with the Shi'ar's laser beam instead of an ancient weapon), but with her death, the Phoenix Force is purified, and it uses its powers to resurrect Jean, drawing on the combined life-force of the assembled X-Men. Jean retains her original basic powers.
* The Phoenix Force makes a cameo appearance in the last episode of ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]''. During a confrontation with [[Professor X]] as a Horsemen of Apocalypse, the Phoenix briefly forms from Jean Grey's shield during their psychic battle. Following Apocalypse's defeat, her other cameo is part of Professor X's glimpse of the future, and shows her host screaming out as the Phoenix.<ref>''X-Men: Evolution'' - "Ascension (Part 2)"</ref>
* The Phoenix makes an appearance in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]''. The Phoenix Force is an entity that has afflicted psychic mutants since the Homo Superior race first appeared. It enters the host at birth and grows with it. Once they reach maturity, the Phoenix Force takes over the host to cause mass destruction.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' - "Foresight (Part 1)"</ref> Emma Frost's own intent is to lure the Phoenix out of Jean Grey's body to put an end to the damage that it causes with help from the Hellfire Club and the Stepford Cuckoos. However, the Hellfire Club and the Stepford Cuckoos reveal their ulterior motives. It is also revealed that Jean caused the explosion at the Xavier Institute from transforming into the Phoenix because of the Hellfire Club's first attempt to take the Phoenix's power. Jean and Cyclops face the Phoenix, risking it devastating the planet and creating the future the X-Men had been trying to prevent, but Wolverine allows Emma to join the fight to seemingly sacrifice herself to stop the Phoenix by absorbing it into her body before turning into her diamond form and shattering herself into pieces. The Phoenix Force seemingly vanishes without a host.
* The Phoenix makes appearances in the beginning and final episodes of ''[[Marvel Anime]]: X-Men''.

===Films===
* [[Famke Janssen]] plays Jean Grey in the first three movies. In ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', Jean uses [[Cerebro]] for the first time, which puts strain on both her mind and abilities, and is affected when Magneto tries to use a machine to turn the world leaders into mutants by said machine's destruction. 
* In ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'', a fiery aura appears in Jean's eyes when using her powers, and she is engulfed in a fiery aura as she sacrifices herself to hold back a [[tsunami]] of water from a burst dam and lift the [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]] to save the X-Men. In the final scene, a giant [[Phoenix (mythology)|flaming bird]]-shaped object can be seen reflected in the water.<ref>{{cite web|title=How many times has Jean Grey died?|url=http://www.alternatecover.com/features/how-many-times-has-jean-grey-died/|publisher=Alternate Cover|access-date=23 July 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Famke Janssen as Phoenix in X-Men the Last Stand.png|220px|thumb|[[Famke Janssen]] as Dark Phoenix in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'']]
* The Phoenix appears in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. Having survived her supposed death, Jean becomes Dark Phoenix, the only known [[Omega-level mutant|class five mutant]]. Her mutation is seeded in the unconscious part of her mind, and Professor X fears what could happen if she cannot control her near-infinite abilities. He uses his powers to build several psychic barriers in her mind at a young age to isolate most of her powers from her conscious mind, which causes a split in her psyche—Jean, whose limited powers were always in her control; and her dormant side, a purely instinctual, powerful creature that called itself the "Phoenix" with little to no regard toward anyone that Jean cares about. During the movie, with the psychic barriers removed by everything that Jean had gone through in the previous films, Phoenix is eventually able to gain dominance over Jean. Phoenix kills Scott Summers and  Professor X before joining Magneto. Phoenix abstains from the battle on [[Alcatraz]] until military reinforcements show up and try to shoot Jean; Phoenix gains full control and demolishes the island on the molecular level. Facing Phoenix alone, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] calls to Jean. As Logan climbs to her, his flesh is repeatedly and painfully peeled from his [[adamantium]]-covered bones, the healing factor being the only thing keeping Logan alive. When Wolverine reaches Phoenix, it asks if Wolverine would die for the rest of humanity, to which he tells it and Jean that he would only die for her. His words pull Jean to the fore; unable to stop Phoenix, she tells Logan to save her. Wolverine stabs Jean with the claws, killing her and ending the destruction. Jean's tombstone lies on the [[X-Mansion]] ground, beside the markers of her slain teammates.
* Jean Grey appears in ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', portrayed by [[Sophie Turner]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/10/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-says-she-was-cast-as-jean-grey-in-x-men-thanks-to-dark-sansa | title=Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner says she was cast as Jean Grey in X-Men thanks to "Dark Sansa"|date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=August 2, 2015|last=Nicholson|first=Max}}</ref> Jean is one of the most ostracized of Charles Xavier's students because she struggles to control her powers as exhibited when she suffers a premonitory nightmare, shaking the school and causing Xavier strain as he tries to wake and calm her. In the film's climax during the X-Men's battle against Apocalypse, Charles tells Apocalypse in an astral battle ground that he is not the most powerful psychic. After bringing Jean there, Charles convinces her to unleash the full extent of her powers. She shatters Apocalypse's astral projection before disintegrating his physical body, her body surrounded by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|flaming bird]]-shaped aura.
* ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' loosely adapts ''[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]''. Jean loses control of her mental abilities and unleashes the Phoenix.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/07/xmen-dark-phoenix-first-look-cover/|title=X-Men: Dark Phoenix heats up EW's First Look Issue|last=Stack|first=Tim|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 7, 2017|access-date=January 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207170130/http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/07/xmen-dark-phoenix-first-look-cover/|archive-date=December 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> While the original trilogy stated that the Phoenix was Jean's darker personality traits, Jean has some difficulties but has generally suppressed them since her childhood. When the X-Men go up to rescue the shuttle ''Endeavour'' from an apparent solar flare, Jean is left behind in the shuttle when the 'solar flare' strikes it, only for her body to absorb the energy. Jean is later contacted by Vuk, a member of the [[D'Bari]], who claims that her world was destroyed by the "solar flare" that struck Jean. Vuk explains that it is actually a cosmic force of supreme power, a fragment of the energy of the universe itself, though only Jean has been able to contain and handle its immense power. Vuk attempts to encourage Jean to tap that power, allegedly to move beyond old standards, but really intends to absorb the power herself so that she can remake Earth for her people. With the X-Men's support, Jean is able to harness the power inside her and destroy the D'Bari forces, but subsequently departs Earth.
